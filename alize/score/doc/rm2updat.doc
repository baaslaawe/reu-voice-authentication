         Instructions for Updating the NIST Scoring Software for RM2


If you are not using the implementation of the NIST scoring software on the 
RM1 "test disc" CD2-4.1, you must perform a complete installation of the
software as specified in /score/readme.txt to score your DARPA June 1990 
benchmark test results.  However, if you are using the CD2-4.1 version of the
scoring software, you may simply replace the two RM1-specific driver tables
with the corresponding RM2 driver tables on this disc.  When you replace the
tables, be sure to save the original tables if you intend to continue scoring
RM1 test results.  

The following is an example of how you might perform the replacement while
saving the original tables with a ".rm1" extension.  Note: "INSTALL_DIR" 
refers to the directory you currently have the scoring software installed 
under:


% mv INSTALL_DIR/score/drivers/al_sents.snr \
            INSTALL_DIR/score/drivers/al_sents.snr.rm1

% cp [from CD3-1.1] /score/drivers/al_sents.snr INSTALL_DIR/score/drivers/

% mv INSTALL_DIR/score/drivers/senttype.snr \
            INSTALL_DIR/score/drivers/senttype.snr.rm1

% cp [from CD3-1.1] /score/drivers/senttype.snr INSTALL_DIR/score/drivers/
