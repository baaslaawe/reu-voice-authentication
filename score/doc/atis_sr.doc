     ATIS Spontaneous Speech Recognition Scoring Conventions

DRAFT December 20, 1990 


     Output for ATIS domain SR systems (hypothesis sentences or
"HYP" output), submitted as input for NIST's scoring package, may
make use of either of two possible conventions: (1) "Lexical SNOR"
transcriptions similar to those used for the  Resource Management
domain, or (2) .sro ATIS conventions.  Each HYP output line must
have appended to it, the approppriate unique ATIS utterance id
enclosed in parenthesis.

The Lexical SNOR transcriptions are to be used for the "official"
scoring.  

When the "official" scoring for things such as word or sentence
accuracy is to be done, if hypothesis sentences are submitted to
NIST using the .sro transcription format, they will be converted to
both Expanded SNOR and Lexical SNOR transcriptions at NIST via 
defined rule sets, and the Lexical SNOR transcriptions will be used
for the official scoring.  


     The conversion rules that we propose to use to generate the
Lexical SNOR HYP files for scoring spontaneous ATIS-domain speech
recognition are: 

The conversion rules are the same as the existing ATIS .sro  to
.snr rules (listed below) with two exceptions: 

(1) Verbal deletions, marked by '<' and '>', will have the brackets 
    removed, leaving the actual word.

Example:  Before:   <what> <is> <no> what does C U mean
          After:    what is no what does C U mean

(2) "Verbal editing cues" will be cleaned up by removing all      
    placement markers while leaving all spoken words in place.    

Example:  Before:   what day (1) does flight one leave (1 what
          date)   
          After:    what day does flight one leave what date


To provide more detailed diagnostic data, if .sro ATIS conventions
are followed when submitting HYP files to NIST for scoring, the
.sro ATIS format HYP files will be converted at NIST into Expanded-
SNOR HYP files.  NIST may subsequently compute additional results
using spontaneous speech diagnostic tools (that are presently in
development).  

The reference answers for each transcription test set will be
generated by their respective rule sets from the .sro files.

For the Expanded SNOR conversion, the rules are the same as for the
ATIS .sro to SNOR rules (listed below) with five exceptions:

(1) Non-speech events, marked by '[' and ']', will not be removed. 

(2) Verbal deletions, marked by '<' and '>', will not have the    
     brackets removed.  In order to prevent alignment errors,     
     homophone pairs will be generated for each verbal deletion   
     by matching the enclosed orthography.

Example:  For the Sentence:  <where> what does D U mean
Homophone pairs will be defined as: where  and   <where>

(3) False starts, marked by a '-' at the end of a word will not   
         be removed.

(4) Pauses, ' . ' will be marked by the token PAUSE.              

Example: Before:   what . does . . C U mean
         After:    what PAUSE does PAUSE PAUSE C U mean

(5) Mispronounced words, marked by '*', will not have their '*'   
      removed.  Instead, the '*' will be translated into '='      
      to avoid special meaning conflicts with the scoring package. 

Example: Before:   What *does* C U mean
         After:    What =does= C U mean 

[Of course, the existing SNOR-like conventions generate ALL CAPS
format, and the examples cited above should be interpreted in this
sense.] 



ATIS .sro TRANSCRIPTION RULES

The following is adapted from the transcription convention used at
TI for ATIS .sro transcriptions. All rules need not be implemented.

The .sro conventions follow:

(1) Letter and number sequences are spelled out (e.g. "DFW"       
becomes "D F W" and "747" becomes "seven forty seven").      

(2) Words hyphenated in a standard dictionary (e.g. one-way) will 
       retain the hyphen.XXXX

(3) Verbally deleted words will be enclosed in '<' and '>'.       
    Ex.   <what> <is> <no> what does C U mean

(4) Non-speech events will be enclosed in '[' and ']'.  
The current set of known non-speech events is (but not limited to): 
[ah], [aside], [laughter], [cough], [er], [grunt], [mm],
[paper_rustle], [throat_clear], [uh], [um], [unintelligible],
[whisper]         

Ex.   [uh] what [um] does C U mean

(5) Mispronounced words will be enclosed in '*' and '*'.        

Ex.   what *does* C U mean

(6) False start words are marked bY a '-' as the last character
of the word.

Ex.  show me tr- transportation codes
     
(7) Long pauses will be shown by ' . ' (a period with spaces on   
     either side).  Each period represents about a 1 second pause. 

Ex.   what . does . . C U mean
 
(8) These interpretation marks are allowed ':', ',', '!', '.'     
       ':'  implies elongation
       ','  implies a phrase pause
       '!'  implies an emphasized letter
       '.'  marks the end of a sentence
       '?'  marks the end of a sentence asked as a question      

(9) Verbal edits will be marked by edit queues.  A marker         
of the form "(n)" where n is a number from 1 to 9 where         
mark the intended insertion point.  Later in the sentence,        
the verbally edited words will be marked in parenthesis in the form
"(n word1 word2 ...)" where n is the same number in the marker.
Ex.  what does (1) flight one arrive (1 what date)      

(10) Words are case-insensitive.


ATIS .sro to .snr CONVERSION RULES

(1) A characters are changed to uppercase.

(2) Verbally deleted words, surrounded for '<' and '>' are
removed.

Example: Before: <what> <is> <no> what does c u mean
         After:  WHAT DOES C U MEAN

(3) Non-speech events, surrounded for '[' and ']' are
removed.

Example: Before: [uh] what [um] does C U mean
         After:  WHAT DOES C U MEAN

(4) Mispronounced word, enclosed in '*' and '*', will have the
asterisks removed.

Example: Before: what *does* C U mean
         After:  WHAT DOES C U MEAN

(5) False start words, marked by a '-' as the last character of
the word, will be removed.

Example: Before: show me tr- transportation codes
         After:  SHOW ME TRANSPORTATION CODES

(6) Long pauses will be shown by ' . ' (a period with spaces on
either side), will be removed.

Example: Before: what . does . . C U mean
         After:  WHAT DOES C U MEAN

(7) These interpretation marks (':', ',', '!', '.') will be
removed.

Example: Before: what do:es !C U mean.
         After:  WHAT DOES C U MEAN
