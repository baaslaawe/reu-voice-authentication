;;  The following table consists of homophones from the Resource Management
;;  Database (SNOR Format).  This table is (normally) consulted when scoring
;;  system output from a speech recognition system that did not use a
;;  restrictive grammar.  In this case, when a substitution of a homophone
;;  occurs, the scoring program counts them as correctly recognized.
