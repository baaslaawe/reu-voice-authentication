GUM CHEWERS IN SINGAPORE WERE IN A STICKY SITUATION WEDNESDAY (447R800T)
THAT WAS WHEN THE NATIONWIDE BAN ON GUM CHEWING WENT INTO EFFECT (447R800U)
THE GUM CHEWING BAN WAS A DIRECT RESULT OF THE COUNTRY'S NEW EMPHASIS ON HYGIENE (447R800V)

WE JUST HAPPEN TO SELL LEDERHOSEN (447S6003)
IF WE SOLD END TABLES WE'D USE MOZART TOO (447S6004)
THE JAPANESE FASCINATION WITH THE CENTURIES OLD COMPOSER IS ONE OF THE MYRIAD OF STRANGE PHENOMENON PARTICULAR TO THEIR CULTURE (447S6005)
WALKING THROUGH THE STREETS OF TOKYO IT'S CLEAR THAT MOZART IS MORE THAN JUST A COMPOSER WITH A FUNNY WHITE WIG (447S6006)
TO THE JAPANESE HE'S BIGGER THAN ELVIS BIGGER THAN HIROHITO BIGGER THAN LIFE ITSELF (447S6007)

WITH CLINTON'S PENCHANT FOR SELF DESTRUCTION BROWN REMAINS A VIABLE CANDIDATE EVEN IF HIS SPEECHES SOMETIMES WANDER TOWARD THE FARTHER REACHES OF THE GALAXY (447S600B)
HOWEVER SERIOUS POLITICAL ANALYSTS DON'T SEE HOW BROWN CAN OVERCOME CLINTON'S HUGE LEAD BUILT THROUGH PREVIOUS PRIMARIES (447S600C)
AS ONE REPORTER WHO HAS BEEN COVERING THE CAMPAIGN FROM THE BEGINNING PUTS IT I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THIS GUY EVEN GETS ONE VOTE (447S600D)
HOWEVER BROWN'S CONSTANT USE OF HIS EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER HAS STRUCK A CHORD WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC (447S600E)
IT HAS BECOME ALMOST A GAME FOR THE CANDIDATE TO SEE HOW MANY TIMES HE CAN RECITE THE NUMBER ON NATIONAL TELEVISION BROADCASTS (447S600F)

ACCORDING TO AN ESTIMATE BY FULTON PREBON U. S. A. (4OGC0309)
INC. THE RATE CLIMBED TO AN AVERAGE OF SIX POINT EIGHT THREE PERCENT FROM WEDNESDAY'S AVERAGE OF SIX POINT SEVEN FIVE PERCENT (4OGC030A)
THE FUNDS RATE IS THE RATE ON RESERVES THAT BANKS LEND EACH OTHER OVERNIGHT (4OGC030B)
THERE ALSO ARE LIMITS ON HOW MUCH A STOCK CAN DROP IN A SINGLE DAY (4OGC030C)
SONY CORP. FOR EXAMPLE HAS A DAILY DECLINE LIMIT OF FIVE HUNDRED YEN (4OGC030D)

OTHER PAPER STOCKS ALSO HAD A HEALTHY RUN (4OGC0403)
THE DOLLAR'S DROP HAS MADE JAPANESE PRODUCTS MORE EXPENSIVE HERE HELPING TO IMPROVE THE COMPETITIVENESS OF U. S. PRODUCTS (4OGC0404)
BUT THE DOLLAR'S CONTINUED WEAKNESS IS STIRRING FEARS OF RECESSION IN JAPAN AND OF RENEWED INFLATION IN THE U. S. (4OGC0405)
AS A RESULT BOTH COUNTRIES ARE SEEKING TO STABILIZE THEIR CURRENCIES AT CURRENT LEVELS (4OGC0406)
THE ACQUISITION REMAINS SUBJECT TO FLORIDA REGULATORY APPROVAL AND CERTAIN OTHER CONDITIONS (4OGC0407)
FLORIDA COMMERCIAL SAID THE TRANSACTION SHOULD CLOSE BY MARCH ONE (4OGC0408)
BOTH CONCERNS ARE BANK HOLDING COMPANIES (4OGC0409)
THE ASSOCIATION SAID THE GROWTH IS BEING FUELED BY DEMAND FOR CHIPS IN PERSONAL COMPUTERS ENGINEERING WORKSTATIONS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT (4OGC040A)

N. T. T. SHARES CLOSED FRIDAY AT TWO POINT TWO MILLION YEN SIXTEEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN DOLLARS EACH OFF THIRTY THOUSAND YEN (4OGC040H)
AT THAT LEVEL THE NEW N. T. T. SALE WOULD BRING IN ABOUT THREE POINT THREE TRILLION YEN TWENTY FOUR POINT SIX SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS (4OGC040I)
IT'S STILL THREE POINTS UP AND FORTY POINTS DOWN IN A LOT OF THESE DEALS SAYS A TRADER AT ONE WALL STREET PARTNERSHIP (4OGC040J)
INSTITUTIONS BECOME HUGE SELLERS WITH NO BUYERS UNDERNEATH THEM (4OGC040K)
THERE'S NO SAFETY NET (4OGC040L)
NOT SURPRISINGLY THE DAVIS ZWEIG REPORT HAS BECOME MORE BEARISH DROPPING TO A TWENTY FIVE PERCENT BOND POSITION AROUND MID APRIL (4OGC0501)

MEANWHILE THE BOND MARKET RALLIED SHARPLY FOR THE DAY (4OGC0503)
LIKE EQUITIES JUNK BONDS RESPOND MORE TO THE FUNDAMENTALS OF A COMPANY THE ECONOMY AND THE THREAT OF DEFAULT SAID MR. FRIDSON (4OGC0504)
IN CONTRAST GOVERNMENT AND HIGHLY RATED CORPORATE AND MUNICIPAL BONDS APPARENTLY "QUOTE ARE PURE INTEREST RATE INSTRUMENTS WITH NO DEFAULT RISK "UNQUOTE (4OGC0505)

IN REALITY IT'S PROBABLY SIX TIMES AS MUCH (4OGC0509)
THIS DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT HEADQUARTERS IS WASTING MONEY (4OGC050A)
IT MAY WELL BE INVOLVED IN VALUE ADDING ACTIVITIES (4OGC050B)
THE POINT IS IT HAD BETTER BE AT THESE COSTS (4OGC050C)
WITHOUT INSTITUTIONAL BUYERS MORTGAGE BANKERS AND OTHER LENDERS THAT USUALLY SELL THEIR RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES TO INVESTORS WOULD BE FORCED TO HOLD THE LOANS (4OGC050D)
THRIFTS GENERALLY CAN AFFORD TO DO THIS BECAUSE THEY CAN USE OTHER ASSETS TO FUND NEW MORTGAGES (4OGC050E)
BUT MANY OTHER LENDERS DON'T HAVE THAT CAPACITY BECAUSE THEY USE CASH FROM THE SALE OF THEIR MORTGAGES TO WRITE NEW LOANS (4OGC050F)
ONLY A FEW REPUBLICAN LEGISLATORS ARE SUPPORTING MR. DEUKMEJIAN'S TAX INCREASE PLAN (4OGC050G)

THE TRUST WILL PAY TWO POINT FIVE PERCENT OF PRETAX PROFITS TO TWO HUNDRED WORKERS (4OGC0602)

SO HIGHER PAID PEOPLE WHITES WILL GET MORE MONEY (4OGC0604)
BOTH SUITS WERE FILED IN FEDERAL COURT IN MINNEAPOLIS WHERE DAYTON HUDSON IS BASED (4OGC0605)

EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS FOR THE COMPANY'S PILOTS AND MACHINISTS WOULD OWN THE REST (4OGC080C)

IT IS AIMED AT JAPAN (4OGC0902)
THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD RECENTLY ACCEPTED TWO JAPANESE FIRMS AS PRIMARY DEALERS (4OGC0903)

TOMORROW THE HOUSE WILL VOTE FOR ONLY THE SECOND TIME IN HISTORY ON A BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION (4OGC0J1S)
THE LAST TIME IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO THE VOTE IN FAVOR WAS TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX TO ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SEVEN BUT IT DIDN'T WIN THE NECESSARY TWO THIRDS (4OGC0J1T)
THE VOTE THIS TIME WILL BE CLOSE (4OGC0J1U)
BUT EVEN IF IT PASSES THE DANGER IS THE WINNING AMENDMENT WILL TREAT THE SYMPTOMS OF DEFICIT SPENDING WITHOUT APPLYING THE NEEDED CURE EFFECTIVE RESTRAINTS ON SPENDING (4OGC0J1V)
DEMOCRATIC HOUSE LEADERS BOTTLED UP THE BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT IN COMMITTEE FOR YEARS EVEN THOUGH THIS YEAR A SOLID MAJORITY OF TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE MEMBERS SPONSORED IT (4OGC0J1W)
THE ONLY CHANCE OF GETTING A VOTE IN THE FULL HOUSE WAS TO PERSUADE TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN MEMBERS TO SIGN A DISCHARGE PETITION BRINGING IT TO THE FLOOR (4OGC0J1X)
ENOUGH MEMBERS WERE LEERY OF OFFENDING HOUSE LEADERS THAT THE PETITION LANGUISHED (4OGC0J1Y)
THE AMENDMENT FINALLY BROKE FREE LAST MONTH WHEN G. O. P. REPUBLICAN CHUCK DOUGLAS THREATENED TO REVEAL THE NAMES OF THOSE CO SPONSORS WHO WERE HYPOCRITICALLY REFUSING TO SIGN THE DISCHARGE PETITION (4OGC0J1Z)

MEMBERS WILL FIRST VOTE ON A PROPOSAL BY TEXAS G. O. P. REPUBLICAN JOE BARTON WHICH REQUIRES A BALANCED BUDGET UNLESS THREE FIFTHS OF CONGRESS AGREES TO A DEFICIT (4OGC0J22)
INCREASES IN GOVERNMENT REVENUES WOULD BE LIMITED TO THE GROWTH OF NATIONAL INCOME SIMILAR TO THE GANN LIMIT THAT CURBS SPENDING IN CALIFORNIA (4OGC0J23)
A THREE FIFTHS VOTE OF CONGRESS WOULD BE NEEDED TO RAISE THE LIMIT (4OGC0J24)
AFTER THE BARTON AMENDMENT MEMBERS WILL VOTE ON ONE BY G. O. P. REPRESENTATIVE LARRY CRAIG AND DEMOCRATIC REPRESENTATIVE CHARLES STENHOLM (4OGC0J25)
IT WOULD NOT EXPLICITLY RESTRAIN GOVERNMENT SPENDING AND REQUIRES ONLY A MAJORITY OF BOTH HOUSES TO BALANCE THE BUDGET THROUGH HIGHER TAXES (4OGC0J26)
ONLY THE ONE WITH THE MOST VOTES GOES ON FOR A FINAL UP OR DOWN FLOOR VOTE (4OGC0J27)
WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SKEPTICAL OF HOW MUCH A BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT COULD RESTRAIN THE SPENDING HABITS OF A WILY CONGRESS (4OGC0J28)
MEMBERS ARE EXPERT AT CREATING OFF BUDGET SPENDING AND THE NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR BUDGET ACT WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO CURB SPENDING HAS BEEN WAIVED BY CONGRESS THREE HUNDRED AND NINETY EIGHT TIMES IN THE PAST DECADE (4OGC0J29)
WE'VE FELT THERE WAS AS MUCH CHANCE THAT AN AMENDMENT WOULD LEAD TO HIGHER TAXES AS IT WOULD CURB SPENDING (4OGC0J2A)
EVEN SO WE RECOGNIZE THAT TOMORROW'S VOTE IS AN IMPORTANT ONE (4OGC0J2B)
HERE IS A SHORT GUIDE TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH YOUR REPRESENTATIVE IS SERIOUS ABOUT CONTROLLING THE SIZE OF GOVERNMENT (4OGC0J2C)

ONE REASON IS THE RATHER PERSISTENT ANTIQUATED BELIEF THAT CASH BASED ACCOUNTING IS THE EASIEST ACCOUNTING METHOD FOR THE PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND (4OHC0202)
THAT POINT OF VIEW HAD SOME VALIDITY WHEN GOVERNMENTS WERE SIMPLE AND WHEN ACCOUNTING WAS RATHER LIKE WHAT I DO EACH MONTH WHEN I BALANCE MY CHECKING ACCOUNT (4OHC0203)

THAT WAS LOWER THAN MANY ANALYSTS HAD EXPECTED LATE WEDNESDAY (4OHC0I0D)
BUT IT WAS WELL ABOVE THE SEVEN POINT ZERO PERCENT AVERAGE AT THE PREVIOUS AUCTION OF SIMILAR NOTES MARCH TWENTY SIXTH (4OHC0I0E)
IT ALSO WAS THE HIGHEST SINCE AN AUCTION IN JANUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX WHEN THE AVERAGE YIELD WAS EIGHT POINT EIGHT FIVE PERCENT (4OHC0I0F)
THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE ROSE SLIGHTLY (4OHC0I0G)
ACCORDING TO AN ESTIMATE BY FULTON PREBON U. S. A. (4OHC0I0H)

UNDER THE PLAN ODD LOT HOLDERS OF RECORD YESTERDAY WOULD SUBMIT SHARES TO THEIR BROKERS WHO WOULD TURN THEM OVER TO THE COMPANY'S AGENT (4OHC0I0K)

SO HIGHER PAID PEOPLE WHITES WILL GET MORE MONEY (4OHC0I0Q)
BUT MR. MCGILLICUDDY CAUTIONED THAT TOO MUCH IS BEING MADE OF THE TRADE DEFICIT (4OHC0I0R)
A FEW YEARS AGO EVERYONE WAS FOCUSED ON MONEY SUPPLY FIGURES SUCH AS M. ONE AS A PROXY FOR INTEREST RATES HE SAID (4OHC0I0S)
TODAY M. ONE DOESN'T COUNT FOR A THING (4OHC0I0T)
IN SWING TIME YOU SINGLE OUT TEN CONGRESSMEN IN EACH PARTY FOR YOUR SCORN (4OHC0I0U)
HERE THE CHARGE IS THAT THEY STILL CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN NICARAGUA (4OHC0I0V)
THIS IS CERTAINLY A LESS SERIOUS CHARGE THAN IN THE EARLIER EDITORIAL BUT IT IS JUST AS FALSE (4OHC0I0W)
WHAT YOU PERHAPS MEANT TO SAY IS THAT THESE CONGRESSMEN HAVEN'T YET COMPLETELY AGREED WITH THE JOURNAL'S VIEWS ON WHAT IS GOING ON IN NICARAGUA (4OHC0I0X)

THE PARENTS WOULD PAY ANY PROPERTY TAXES ON THE REAL ESTATE (4OHC0I16)
EXPORTS LESS EXPENSIVE OVERSEAS JUMPED THIRTY PERCENT IN THE FIRST FIVE MONTHS OF THIS YEAR (4OHC0I17)
IMPORTS MORE EXPENSIVE IN AMERICA AREN'T YET FALLING BUT THE GAIN HAS EASED TO ELEVEN PERCENT (4OHC0I18)

BROTHER PIERRE IS EXTOLLING THE VIRTUES OF HIS MONASTIC LIFE FULFILLING WORK IN THE ABBEY'S SMALL BREWERY ALONG WITH PLENTY OF TIME FOR STUDY REFLECTION AND PRAYER (4OHC0J01)
HIS HAIR SHAVEN TO A BLACK STUBBLE THE YOUNG TRAPPIST MONK PEERS EARNESTLY AT A VISITOR IN THE COLD STONE ANTECHAMBER OF THE ROCHEFORT MONASTERY (4OHC0J02)
WHAT WE SEEK HE EXPLAINS IS CALM (4OHC0J03)
SUDDENLY THE CALM IS DISTURBED BY THE BEEPING OF AN ELECTRONIC PAGER HIDDEN SOMEWHERE BENEATH BROTHER PIERRE'S CASSOCK (4OHC0J04)
EXCUSE ME A MOMENT HE SAYS THEN PADS DOWN THE CORRIDOR ON SANDALED FEET TO CONFER WITH A COLLEAGUE (4OHC0J05)
FOR BELGIUM'S TRAPPIST MONKS THE PRESSURES OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD ARE NEVER COMPLETELY ABSENT (4OHC0J06)
THE BEER THEY BREW TO PAY FOR MONASTERY EXPENSES AND CHARITY HAS BECOME SO POPULAR IN RECENT YEARS THAT THEY OFTEN CAN'T KEEP UP WITH DEMAND (4OHC0J07)
OUR CUSTOMERS ARE ON THEIR KNEES BEFORE US SAYS BROTHER PIERRE WHO QUICKLY ADDS THAT THIS IS JUST A MANNER OF SPEAKING (4OHC0J08)
LIKE THE FOUR OTHER TRAPPIST MONASTERIES THAT PRODUCE BEER IN BELGIUM ROCHEFORT'S ABBEY SOMETIMES HAS TO RATION ITS SUPPLY AMONG ITS MOST LOYAL CUSTOMERS (4OHC0J09)
THE BEER IS SCARCE PARTLY BECAUSE THERE IS A SHORTAGE OF MONKS TO BREW IT (4OHC0J0A)
AS IN OTHER WEALTHY WESTERN COUNTRIES TRAPPISTS HERE FIND THAT FEWER AND FEWER YOUNG MEN WANT TO ADOPT THE AUSTERE MONASTIC LIFE (4OHC0J0B)
THE AVERAGE AGE OF TRAPPIST MONKS IN BELGIUM IS WELL OVER SIXTY THE ROCHEFORT ABBEY HASN'T HAD A NEW RECRUIT SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO (4OHC0J0C)
THUS ONLY A FEW MONKS ARE AVAILABLE FOR BREWING AT MOST OF THE ABBEYS (4OHC0J0D)
AT THE ORVAL MONASTERY FOR INSTANCE ONLY ONE OF THE THIRTY FIVE MONKS FATHER BRUNO WORKS IN THE BREWERY (4OHC0J0E)
WEARING A BLUE LAB COAT HE SUPERVISES TWENTY SIX OUTSIDE WORKERS IN A BUSINESS WITH ANNUAL SALES EQUIVALENT TO ABOUT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS (4OHC0J0F)
TO WORK EIGHT HOURS A DAY IS DIFFICULT FOR A MONK FATHER BRUNO SAYS SOFTLY (4OHC0J0G)
THEY HAVE OTHER THINGS TO DO (4OHC0J0H)
SOME BAKE BREAD OTHERS MAKE CHEESE (4OHC0J0I)
A FEW ARE TOO OLD TO DO MUCH WORK OF ANY KIND (4OHC0J0J)
EVEN SO FATHER BRUNO REASONS THAT THE MONASTERY CAN CONTINUE TO CLAIM ITS BEER IS BREWED BY TRAPPIST MONKS AS LONG AS THEY CONTROL THE FINANCES QUALITY AND PROMOTION (4OHC0J0K)
A MAJORITY OF AMERICANS THE POLLS SAY FAVOR MILITARY ACTION AGAINST IRAQ EVEN IF THEIR FELLOW AMERICANS ARE STILL TRAPPED THERE (4OHC0J0L)
BUT PATTY HALE IS DEFINITELY NOT WITH THE MAJORITY (4OHC0J0M)

I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT ANYBODY WHO HAS A FAMILY MEMBER THERE WOULD BE INTERESTED IN DROPPING BOMBS SHE SAYS UNLESS THEY WERE INTERESTED IN INSTANT DIVORCE (4OHC0J0P)
AND THAT'S CERTAINLY NOT IN MY MIND (4OHC0J0Q)
MR. AND MRS. HALE HAVE BEEN MARRIED TWENTY TWO YEARS (4OHC0J0R)
THE RELATIVES OF THE U. S. CITIZENS IN KUWAIT AND IRAQ OBSERVE WITH MUTED HORROR AS PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR COMBAT APPEARS TO MOUNT (4OHC0J0S)
ON AUGUST EIGHTH FORTY NINE PERCENT OF AMERICANS FAVORED MILITARY ACTION EVEN IF HOSTAGES WERE HARMED A U. S. A. TODAY GANNETT NEWS SERVICE POLL FOUND (4OHC0J0T)
BY AUGUST TWENTY SECOND THE SAME POLL FOUND THAT FIGURE HAD RISEN TO FIFTY FOUR PERCENT (4OHC0J0U)
AND IN A WALL STREET JOURNAL N. B. C. POLL TAKEN THIS WEEK FIFTY THREE PERCENT OF AMERICANS SURVEYED SAID THEY WOULD SUPPORT MILITARY ACTION IN SPITE OF THE HOSTAGES (4OHC0J0V)
MICHAEL SABA FOUNDER OF COMING HOME A GROUP REPRESENTING HOSTAGE RELATIVES SAID THAT FOR ALL OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS THEIR CONCERN WAS WITH THIS ATTITUDE OF LET'S GO OVER THERE AND KICK THEIR BUTTS (4OHC0J0W)
IT'S EXTREMELY FRIGHTENING TO THEM (4OHC0J0X)
BUT MR. SABA SAID THAT MANY RELATIVES OF HOSTAGES HE HAS TALKED TO FEEL COMPELLED TO PUBLICLY SUPPORT MR. BUSH'S HAWKISH STANCE (4OHC0J0Y)
THEY DON'T WANT TO SOUND UNPATRIOTIC HE SAYS (4OHC0J0Z)
DONNITA COLE IS A MILITARY MOM AND A HOSTAGE WIFE (4OHC0J10)
HER SON IS A U. S. SOLDIER STATIONED IN THE SAUDI DESERT HER HUSBAND A HUMAN SHIELD SOMEWHERE IN IRAQ (4OHC0J11)

I'D LIKE FOR THESE PEOPLE CALLING FOR MILITARY ACTION TO TALK TO ME MRS. COLE SAYS (4OHC0J14)
I WOULD LIKE FOR THEM TO TELL ME FACE TO FACE THAT MY JOHNNY IS EXPENDABLE (4OHC0J15)
THESE ARE STILL LIVE HUMAN BEINGS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT (4OHC0J16)
YOUR NOVEMBER NINETEENTH PAGE ONE ARTICLE ABOUT DRUGS AND PUBLIC OPINION REVEALED THE PERSISTENCE OF THE DRUG CRISIS BUT UNDERSTATED AMERICANS' RESOLVE TO CONFRONT THE PROBLEM (4OHC0J17)
YOU DESCRIBED A FALLOFF IN PUBLIC CONCERN ABOUT DRUGS AND CITED EVIDENCE FROM A WALL STREET JOURNAL N. B. C. POLL (4OHC0J18)
BUT YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL IN REFERENCES TO OPINION POLLS (4OHC0J19)
WHEN SOMEONE IS SURVEYED THEY ARE USUALLY ASKED TWO KINDS OF QUESTIONS (4OHC0J1A)
ONE IS OPEN ENDED ASKING THE RESPONDENT TO LIST WHAT HE OR SHE THINKS ARE THE MOST CRITICAL ISSUES FACING THE NATION (4OHC0J1B)
THE OTHER KIND OF QUESTION IS MORE STRUCTURED ASKING RESPONDENTS TO RATE A LIST OF ISSUES ON A SCALE FOR EXAMPLE FROM UNIMPORTANT TO CRUCIAL (4OHC0J1C)
ANSWERS TO THE OPEN ENDED QUESTIONS CAN CHANGE WEEK TO WEEK DEPENDING ON CURRENT EVENTS (4OHC0J1D)
ANSWERS TO THE RATING TYPE QUESTIONS PROVIDE A MORE ACCURATE PICTURE OF PEOPLE'S LONG TERM CONCERNS (4OHC0J1E)
ACCORDING TO GORDON BLACK THE POLLSTER YOUR REPORTER INTERVIEWED PEOPLE'S RESPONSES TO THE STRUCTURED QUESTIONS ABOUT DRUGS HAVEN'T CHANGED AT ALL (4OHC0J1F)
AMERICANS CONSISTENTLY RATE DRUGS AS A CRUCIAL ISSUE THAT WILL REQUIRE LONG TERM ATTENTION BY GOVERNMENT (4OHC0J1G)
HOWEVER IF SOMEONE WERE ASKED TODAY TO STATE THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE FACING THE NATION HE MOST LIKELY WOULD SAY THE PERSIAN GULF CRISIS OR THE IMPENDING RECESSION (4OHC0J1H)
IN OTHER WORDS THE DRUG CRISIS IS NO LESS IMPORTANT TO AMERICANS THAT IT WAS A YEAR AGO (4OHC0J1I)
THERE SIMPLY ARE A GREATER NUMBER OF CRITICAL ISSUES TODAY (4OHC0J1J)
I AGREE THAT AS CRISES RECEDE FROM THE MIDDLE CLASS THEY OFTEN BECOME GHETTOIZED AS YOU CALL IT AND FALL FROM PUBLIC VIEW (4OHC0J1K)
AS ACCEPTANCE AND CASUAL USE OF DRUGS DECREASE WE RUN THE RISK OF COMPLACENCY WITH THE CURRENT STATE OF ANTI DRUG EFFORTS (4OHC0J1L)
BUT THE DROP OFF IN DRUG ACCEPTANCE HAS NOT JUST OCCURRED AMONG THE WHITE MIDDLE CLASS (4OHC0J1M)
MR. BLACK MAINTAINS THAT AFRICAN AMERICANS AND HISPANICS HAVE CHANGED THEIR ATTITUDES AS MUCH IF NOT MORE THAN WHITE AMERICANS (4OHC0J1N)
THE DRUG CRISIS HINGES ON THE EVER INCREASING NUMBER OF HARD CORE ADDICTS OF ALL CLASSES AND RACES (4OHC0J1O)
DRUGS DIRECTLY AFFECT A NUMBER OF ISSUES SUCH AS CRIME AIDS AND HEALTH CARE THAT AMERICANS RANK HIGH IN IMPORTANCE (4OHC0J1P)
REFERENCES TO OPINION POLLS OFTEN DO NOT SHOW THE INTERRELATEDNESS OF THESE TOPICS AND THEREFORE FAIL TO REVEAL THE EXTENT OF PEOPLE'S CONCERN (4OHC0J1Q)

WE ARE TEMPTED BEYOND ENDURANCE SO WE HEREBY ENTHUSIASTICALLY CHEER PASSAGE OF PENNSYLVANIA'S PROPOSED ANTI TAKEOVER ANTI PROXY BILL (4OJC0J01)
IT IS INDEED AN AWFUL PIECE OF LEGISLATION (4OJC0J02)
JUST YESTERDAY S. E. C. CHAIRMAN RICHARD BREEDEN WARNED THAT PENNSYLVANIA'S BILL WOULD "QUOTE SHIELD MANAGEMENT FROM INVESTOR OVERSIGHT "END-QUOTE AND HE THREATENED TO USE FEDERAL LAWS TO INVALIDATE PARTS OF THE BILL (4OJC0J03)
NONETHELESS IN THE INTEREST OF FINANCIAL SCIENCE WE SAY BRING IT ON (4OJC0J04)
THERE IS NOTHING LIKE FEDERALISM'S FIFTY PETRIE DISHES TO SHOW WHICH STATE CORPORATE LAWS ATTRACT CAPITAL AND JOBS AND WHICH SPOOK INVESTORS AND HANDICAP LOCAL ECONOMIES (4OJC0J05)
PENNSYLVANIA IS ABOUT TO MAKE THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE ON BEHALF OF THIS KNOWLEDGE (4OJC0J06)
AT THE MOMENT IT LOOKS AS IF MANAGERS OF COMPANIES INCORPORATED IN PENNSYLVANIA FOURTH AMONG THE FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED WILL GET FULL DEFENSES AGAINST ANY MARKET OR STOCKHOLDER PRESSURES (4OJC0J07)
THE BILL SPEEDING THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE THIS WEEK WOULD DISGORGE THE PROFIT FROM A STOCKHOLDER WHO SELLS WITHIN EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF LAUNCHING ANY KIND OF BID FOR THE COMPANY (4OJC0J08)
THIS IS PURE EXPROPRIATION (4OJC0J09)
MOREOVER INSTEAD OF THE ANCIENT DUTY TO MAXIMIZE SHARE PRICE DIRECTORS FIGHTING OFF BIDS COULD CONSIDER THE INTERESTS OF STAKEHOLDERS EMPLOYEES SUPPLIERS AND THE LIKE ABOVE THE INTERESTS OF STOCKHOLDERS (4OJC0J0A)
FIDUCIARY DUTY R. I. P. (4OJC0J0B)
THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY FEATURE OF THE BILL IS THAT IT WOULD EVEN MAKE PROXY CONTESTS WHICH ARE ALWAYS DIFFICULT PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE (4OJC0J0C)
THE BILL SAYS THAT ANYONE EXCEPT MANAGERS WHO INITIATES A PROXY MUST BE PREPARED TO BUY THE COMPANY AT A PRICE SET BY A JUDGE (4OJC0J0D)
THIS PROVISION APPLIES EVEN IF THE PROXY IS NOT TO TAKE OVER THE COMPANY BUT ONLY SAY TO CHANGE ACCOUNTING FIRMS (4OJC0J0E)
ANY STOCKHOLDER WHO LAUNCHES A PROXY AND SOLICITS TWENTY PERCENT OF THE VOTES WOULD HAVE TO TENDER FOR ALL SHARES (4OJC0J0F)
YOU MIGHT WONDER WHY THE COUNTRY'S MOST RADICAL ANTI TAKEOVER BILL COMES DURING A LULL IN THE TAKEOVER BATTLES AND THE PROBLEMS IN THE JUNK BOND MARKET (4OJC0J0G)

IT TURNS OUT WE WERE OFF BY TWO YEARS WHEN WE ENDED AN EDITORIAL WITH THOSE WORDS ON NOVEMBER TEN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX (4OJC0J0O)
THE HUNDRED AND FIRST CONGRESS IS THE ONE THAT NOW GETS TO CLEAN UP THE MESS PRODUCED BY THE SIMPSON MAZZOLI IMMIGRATION "QUOTE REFORM "UNQUOTE OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX (4OJC0J0P)
A GOOD PLACE TO START WOULD BE TO REPEAL THE BILL'S PROVISION FOR "QUOTE EMPLOYER SANCTIONS "END-QUOTE WHICH IS WE ARE NOW LEARNING A SYNONYM FOR HARASSMENT (4OJC0J0Q)
THIS IS THE LAW THAT FINES EMPLOYERS UP TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND SIX MONTHS IN JAIL FOR HIRING AN "QUOTE ILLEGAL "END-QUOTE ALIEN (4OJC0J0R)
LAST WEEK THE GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE RELEASED A STUDY CONCLUDING THAT THE PROVISION HAD CAUSED "QUOTE WIDESPREAD DISCRIMINATION "END-QUOTE AGAINST WORKERS ESPECIALLY HISPANICS (4OJC0J0S)

THIS ECHOES SIMILAR FINDINGS BY STUDIES IN NEW YORK AND CALIFORNIA (4OJC0J0U)
IN DEFENDING THE LAW SENATOR ALAN SIMPSON SAYS THAT THERE MAY BE DISCRIMINATION BUT DENIES IT IS "QUOTE WIDESPREAD "END-QUOTE (4OJC0J0V)
WE'D LIKE TO SEE HIM PARSE THAT DISTINCTION FOR HISPANICS NEEDING A JOB (4OJC0J0W)
AS AN ARM OF CONGRESS THE G. A. O. TENDS TO GO EASY ON THE MEMBERS' HANDIWORK BUT IN THIS CASE IT COULDN'T IGNORE THE FACTS (4OJC0J0X)
THE G. A. O. SURVEYED A RANDOM SAMPLE OF NINE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY ONE EMPLOYERS AND ESTIMATED THAT NINETEEN PERCENT BEGAN TO DISCRIMINATE AS A RESULT OF SIMPSON MAZZOLI (4OJC0J0Y)
ABOUT TEN PERCENT DISCRIMINATED ON THE BASIS OF PHYSICAL APPEARANCE OR ACCENT AND ANOTHER NINE PERCENT WERE ONLY HIRING NATIVE BORN CITIZENS (4OJC0J0Z)
THE G. A. O. EXTRAPOLATES THAT EIGHT HUNDRED AND NINETY ONE THOUSAND EMPLOYERS "QUOTE OF THE FOUR POINT SIX MILLION IN THE POPULATION SURVEYED REPORTED BEGINNING DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES BECAUSE OF THE LAW "END-QUOTE (4OJC0J10)
SURE SOUNDS "QUOTE WIDESPREAD "UNQUOTE TO US (4OJC0J11)
YET THIS PROBABLY UNDERSTATES ANY DISCRIMINATION SINCE NO ONE LIKES TO ADMIT TO PREJUDICE (4OJC0J12)
WORSE THE DISCRIMINATION WAS MOST PRONOUNCED IN AREAS WITH THE LARGEST HISPANIC AND ASIAN POPULATIONS TWENTY NINE PERCENT OF EMPLOYERS IN LOS ANGELES FOR EXAMPLE (4OJC0J13)
SO THE LAW DOES ITS WORST PRECISELY WHERE RACIAL COMITY IS MOST IMPORTANT (4OJC0J14)
THE LAW WAS ALREADY NOTORIOUS FOR HARASSING EMPLOYERS (4OJC0J15)
BY LAST SEPTEMBER THE U. S. IMMIGRATION SERVICE HAD ASSESSED SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN FINES FOR THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED CASES OF HIRING ILLEGALS AND THIRTY SIX THOUSAND CASES OF FAILING TO FILL OUT I. N. S. PAPERWORK (4OJC0J16)

THIS IS A HAPPY DAY FOR CANADA MR. MULRONEY SAID (4OJC0J1E)
BUT NEWFOUNDLAND PREMIER CLYDE WELLS REFUSED TO ENDORSE THE ACCORD WHICH HE SAID "QUOTE IS BAD "UNQUOTE FOR CANADA (4OJC0J1F)
HE SIGNED ONLY SO HE CAN SUBMIT THE PACT FOR APPROVAL TO HIS LEGISLATURE IN A FREE VOTE OR DIRECTLY TO NEWFOUNDLANDERS IN A REFERENDUM (4OJC0J1G)
THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY MAY INDEED BE AT STAKE MR. WELLS SAID (4OJC0J1H)

NEWFOUNDLANDERS MUST MAKE THEIR DECISION WITHIN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS (4OJC0J1K)
THE AGREEMENT IS DESIGNED TO BREAK A DEADLOCK OVER THE MEECH LAKE ACCORD A PACKAGE OF PROPOSED CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS (4OJC0J1L)
THE MEECH LAKE ACCORD MUST BE RATIFIED BY ALL TEN PROVINCIAL LEGISLATURES BY JUNE TWENTY THIRD TO TAKE EFFECT (4OJC0J1M)
IN RECENT OPINION POLLS A MAJORITY OF QUEBECERS SAID THAT THEY WOULD SUPPORT POLITICAL INDEPENDENCE FOR THEIR PROVINCE IF MEECH LAKE ISN'T RATIFIED (4OJC0J1N)
THE ACCORD HAS BECOME AN ENORMOUSLY POWERFUL SYMBOL IN QUEBEC AND IS THE PROVINCE'S MINIMUM PRICE FOR REMAINING HAPPILY IN THE CANADIAN FEDERATION (4OJC0J1O)
THREE PROVINCES NEW BRUNSWICK MANITOBA AND NEWFOUNDLAND REFUSED TO RATIFY MEECH LAKE AS DRAFTED AND DEMANDED CHANGES (4OJC0J1P)
MR. MULRONEY AND THE TEN PREMIERS SPENT MORE THAN SEVENTY HOURS BEHIND CLOSED DOORS LAST WEEK TRYING TO FIND A COMPROMISE (4OJC0J1Q)
NEW BRUNSWICK AND MANITOBA DROPPED THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE ACCORD BUT MR. WELLS WOULDN'T CAVE IN (4OJC0J1R)
THE MEECH LAKE ACCORD RECOGNIZES QUEBEC AS A "QUOTE DISTINCT SOCIETY "END-QUOTE WITHIN CANADA AND GRANTS CERTAIN NEW POWERS TO ALL PROVINCES (4OJC0J1S)
THE "QUOTE DISTINCT SOCIETY "END-QUOTE CLAUSE IS THE KEY STICKING POINT IN THE DEBATE (4OJC0J1T)

BUT IT WAS UP TO PENNSYLVANIA LACOP'S HOME STATE TO DECIDE WHETHER TO SHUT IT DOWN (4OJC0J1Y)
AND PENNSYLVANIA WAITED (4OJC0J1Z)
LACOP ASSURED STATE OFFICIALS THIS PAST JULY THAT IT SOON PLANNED TO SELL ITS POLICIES TO ANOTHER INSURER AND GET OUT OF THE BUSINESS (4OJC0J20)
OFFICIALS DECIDED TO GIVE LACOP MORE TIME EVEN THOUGH ITS BANK ACCOUNTS WERE OVERDRAWN BY TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS (4OJC0J21)
LACOP WROTE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN NEW POLICIES AS THE STATE HELD BACK (4OJC0J22)
THIS FALL LACOP GRADUALLY STOPPED PAYING MOST CLAIMS (4OJC0J23)
FIRST A TRICKLE AND THEN A TORRENT OF CALLS CAME INTO THE INSURANCE DEPARTMENT FROM ANGRY POLICYHOLDERS AND BANKS COMPLAINING ABOUT MISSED PAYMENTS AND BOUNCED CHECKS (4OJC0J24)
IN LATE OCTOBER THE STATE SUSPENDED ALL OPERATIONS AT LACOP AND REGULATORS ARE NOW SEEKING TO HAVE THE COMPANY DECLARED INSOLVENT BY A STATE COURT (4OJC0J25)
STATE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER CONSTANCE FOSTER AN ENERGETIC OFFICIAL WHO HAS BUILT UP A DEPARTMENT THAT HAD DECLINED FOR YEARS SAYS SHE REMAINS ASTOUNDED BY LACOP'S DEMISE (4OJC0J26)
I'LL TELL YOU FRANKLY TO THIS DAY I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS COMPANY BECAME INSOLVENT (4OJC0J27)
THE COMPANY DISPUTES THE NOTION THAT IT IS ACTUALLY INSOLVENT AND SAYS IT PLANS TO CHALLENGE THE STATE IN COURT (4OJC0J28)
THE LACOP CASE ILLUSTRATES SEVERAL PROBLEMS WITH THE WAY INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE REGULATED IN THIS COUNTRY (4OJC0J29)
THOUGH IT REACHES NOT ONLY ACROSS STATE LINES BUT AROUND THE GLOBE INSURANCE IS GOVERNED BY A PATCHWORK OF LOCAL REGULATION THAT IS SUSTAINED BY STATE AND INDUSTRY LOBBYING (4OJC0J2A)
SO DIFFUSE IS THE CURRENT SYSTEM THAT STATE REGULATORS REFER TO COMPANIES HEADQUARTERED IN OTHER STATES AS "QUOTE FOREIGN "UNQUOTE (4OJC0J2B)
THERE IS INCREASING CONCERN THAT THE BUSINESS IS OUTSTRIPPING THE ABILITY OF LAWS REGULATORS AND ACCOUNTING RULES TO GUIDE IT (4OJC0J2C)
THE BUSINESS ITSELF IS RISKIER THAN EVER (4OJC0J2D)
PROPERTY AND CASUALTY CARRIERS WHO ONCE CONCENTRATED ON THE MORE PREDICTABLE HAZARDS OF THEFT AND FIRE NOW ALSO UNDERWRITE FAR RISKIER LINES SUCH AS PRODUCT LIABILITY AND FINANCIAL GUARANTIES (4OJC0J2E)

JIMMY CARTER WAS NOT EXACTLY A SUBMISSIVE EMISSARY (4Q2C0501)
INDEED THE FORMER PRESIDENT SAID ON SUNDAY THAT HE WOULD NEVER HAVE SOUGHT PERMISSION TO GO TO NORTH KOREA IF HE HAD SUPPORTED THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN TO USE ECONOMIC SANCTIONS AGAINST ITS GOVERNMENT IN THE DISPUTE OVER ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM (4Q2C0502)
HE SAID HE STILL FOUND IT INCONCEIVABLE THAT PRESIDENT CLINTON HAD NOT SENT HIS OWN DELEGATION TO NORTH KOREA TO TRY TO RESOLVE THE STANDOFF BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES (4Q2C0503)
AND YET IT WAS CARTER WHO EMERGED FROM THE WHITE HOUSE ON SUNDAY MORNING AFTER BRIEFING ADMINISTRATION AIDES TO PROCLAIM THAT THE PROMISES MADE TO HIM BY NORTH KOREA'S RECLUSIVE LEADERS MEANT THAT THE CRISIS WAS IN EFFECT OVER (4Q2C0504)
THE WHITE HOUSE EXPRESSED HOPE ON SUNDAY THAT CARTER MIGHT HAVE OPENED THE WAY TO A BREAKTHROUGH (4Q2C0505)

THE SEEMING CONTRADICTION IN THE NUMBERS ABOVE GROSS FUND PURCHASES WERE DOWN BETWEEN MARCH AND APRIL BUT NET CASH FLOW IMPROVED ACTUALLY IS EASILY EXPLAINED (4Q3C0206)
OVERALL INVESTORS' APPETITE FOR FUNDS DECLINED IN APRIL (4Q3C0207)
BUT BECAUSE FEWER INVESTORS REDEEMED SHARES IN APRIL THAN MARCH CASH FLOW WAS BETTER (4Q3C0208)

SHE WAS ALWAYS TUNED IN TO THE OVERALL VISUAL IMPACT (4Q3C0406)
SHE HAD A CLASSICAL POINT OF VIEW BUT IT WAS ALWAYS COUCHED IN TERMS OF THE NEW AND DIFFERENT (4Q3C0407)
IT COULD BE A STIMULATING EXPERIENCE TO ACCOMPANY MRS. ONASSIS ON FIELD TRIPS TO MUSEUMS AND GALLERIES MR. KRUZAN RECALLED (4Q3C0408)
WHAT'S LITTLE KNOWN ABOUT MRS. ONASSIS IS HER PLAYFUL SOMETIMES SARDONIC SENSE OF HUMOR RARELY REVEALED IN PUBLIC (4Q3C0409)
I WOULDN'T WANT TO CALL HIM NAIVE OR GULLIBLE A SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL SAID ON SUNDAY (4Q3C0501)
BUT LET'S JUST SAY THAT WE'RE A LOT MORE SKEPTICAL THAN HE IS ABOUT WHETHER THE NORTH KOREANS MEAN WHAT THEY SAY (4Q3C0502)
CARTER SAID KIM IL SUNG THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER HAD ASSURED HIM THAT HIS NATION WAS NOT BUILDING NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND HAD OFFERED TO FREEZE HIS NUCLEAR PROGRAM AS LONG AS HIGH LEVEL TALKS WITH WASHINGTON ARE BEGUN AND CONTINUED (4Q3C0503)
IN HIS HOTEL SUITE HERE ON SUNDAY MORNING CARTER WAS STILL BUOYANT EVEN AFTER A FLIGHT THAT TOOK HIM FROM SOUTH KOREA TO ATLANTA AND THEN TO WASHINGTON (4Q3C0504)

WASHINGTON THE GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE SAID THAT LOANS MADE IN ANTICIPATION OF TAX REFUNDS FOSTER AN ENVIRONMENT CONDUCIVE TO FRAUD AND THAT THE TREND TOWARD MORE TAX REFUND FRAUD IS CONTINUING (4Q4C0201)
MOST BANKS MAKE THESE LOANS CALLED REFUND ANTICIPATION LOANS OR RALS TO TAXPAYERS WHO FILE THEIR RETURNS ELECTRONICALLY (4Q4C0202)
THEY ENABLE ELECTRONIC FILERS FOR A FEE TO GET THE MONEY DUE FROM A REFUND IN TWO OR THREE DAYS INSTEAD OF TWO OR THREE WEEKS (4Q4C0203)
MORE THAN NINETY %PERCENT OF ELECTRONIC FILERS APPLIED FOR RALS IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE THE G. A. O. SAID IN A REPORT IN WHICH IT SUGGESTED THAT THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE DISASSOCIATE ITSELF FROM THESE LOANS (4Q4C0204)
THE G. A. O. ALSO SAID INTERIM RESULTS FROM THE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR TAX FILING SEASON INDICATED THAT FRAUD CONNECTED WITH TAX REFUNDS IS CONTINUING TO RISE (4Q4C0205)
AS OF FEBRUARY TWENTY EIGHTH NINETEEN NINETY FOUR I. R. S.

THE G. A. O. SAID MOST OF THE IDENTIFIED FRAUD CASES INVOLVED RETURNS ON WHICH THE TAXPAYER WAS CLAIMING AN EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT (4Q4C0208)
NOTING THAT RECENT LEGISLATIVE CHANGES EXPANDED ELIGIBILITY FOR THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AND EXPANDED THE MAXIMUM CREDIT AMOUNT THE G. A. O. SAID THOSE CHANGES WILL FIRST AFFECT TAX RETURNS FILED IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE AND COULD ENCOURAGE MORE ATTEMPTS TO DEFRAUD THE SYSTEM (4Q4C0209)
AS FOR REFUND ANTICIPATION LOANS THE G. A. O. SAID THEY FOSTER AN ENVIRONMENT CONDUCIVE TO FRAUD BY SHORTENING THE TIME BETWEEN THE FILING OF A FRAUDULENT ELECTRONIC RETURN AND THE RECEIPT OF THE FINANCIAL PAYOFF FOR THAT ACT (4Q4C020A)
THE PROCESS OF OBTAINING A RAL INCLUDES A STEP IN WHICH THE I. R. S. INFORMS AN ELECTRONIC TAX PREPARER THROUGH A DIRECT DEPOSIT INDICATORS WHETHER IT WILL DEPOSIT THE REFUND DIRECTLY IN THE TAXPAYER'S BANK ACCOUNT (4Q4C020B)
THE I. R. S. TWO YEARS AGO IN A STEP TO DISASSOCIATE ITSELF FROM RALS SAID IT WOULD DISCONTINUE ISSUING THESE DIRECT DEPOSIT INDICTORS (4Q4C020C)
BUT IT LATER REVERSED ITS DECISION AND NOW IS PROPOSING TO CHARGE A FEE OF EIGHT DOLLARS FOR EACH INDICATOR PROVIDED (4Q4C020D)
THE G. A. O. SUGGESTED THAT THE I. R. S. GO BACK TO ITS INITIAL PROPOSAL OF DOING AWAY WITH THE DIRECT DEPOSIT INDICATOR INSTEAD OF CHARGING A FEE (4Q4C020E)

COMPANIES EVENTUALLY WILL PAY A BASE RATE OF FORTY FIVE %PERCENT IN TAXES ON THEIR NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN INCOME (4Q4C0304)
BUT THE ESTIMATED TAXES THEY ARE REQUIRED TO PAY IN ADVANCE WILL BE CALCULATED AS IF THE RATE WERE FORTY TWO %PERCENT (4Q4C0305)
THAT WILL GIVE A SMALL BOOST TO CORPORATE TREASURIES ALTHOUGH THEY WILL HAVE TO PAY THE FULL AMOUNT EVENTUALLY AFTER THEY SUBMIT THEIR TAX RETURNS NEXT YEAR (4Q4C0306)
CONGRESS AND THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE BEGUN TO TAKE THE RIGHT STEPS TO IMPROVE THE CREDIT BUDGET (4Q4C0307)
A PILOT LOAN SALE PROGRAM APPROVED LAST YEAR WOULD PROVIDE A VIRTUALLY RISK FREE TEST OF THIS APPROACH (4Q4C0308)
INITIAL WALL STREET ENTHUSIASM HAS SURPRISED EVEN PRIVATIZATION ADVOCATES (4Q4C0309)
THE FIRST SALES ARE EXPECTED TO GO TO MARKET SOMETIME THIS SUMMER (4Q4C030A)

WE LOOK FOR HIGHER THAN STANDARD RETURNS MR. SPERLING SAYS (4Q4C030F)
IN TODAY'S MARKET THEY ARE ALMOST NEVER AVAILABLE (4Q4C030G)
THERE ARE TOO MANY FOREIGN AND INSTITUTIONAL PLAYERS WILLING TO PAY HIGHER PRICES THAN WE ARE (4Q4C030H)

HE HAS ACTED AS AN INTERMEDIARY IN CONFLICTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST ETHIOPIA THE SUDAN SOMALIA THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA AND OTHER TROUBLE SPOTS (4Q4C0505)
BUT THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAD TWICE REFUSED HIS REQUESTS TO TRAVEL TO NORTH KOREA IN RESPONSE TO A NINETEEN NINETY ONE INVITATION AND CLINTON'S UNEXPECTED DECISION TO APPROVE THE JOURNEY AT A TIME OF MOUNTING TENSIONS GAVE IT EVEN MORE PROMINENCE (4Q4C0506)

THE BROADER THE MIX THE BETTER (4Q6C0305)
EVERY POSITION SHOULD HAVE OUTSIDE TALENT INCLUDED IN THE SELECTION PROCESS (4Q6C0306)
IF INSIDE PEOPLE ARE NOT COMPETITIVE HOW CAN YOUR ORGANIZATION BE COMPETITIVE IN THE MARKETPLACE (4Q6C0307)
IN ADDITION I. B. M.'S PRICING STRATEGY COULD HURT COMPETITORS (4Q6C0308)
FOR EXAMPLE THE COMPANY PLANS BIG DISCOUNTS ON THE NEW ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED NINETY FIVE DOLLAR MACHINE FOR SCHOOLS A MAIN APPLE MARKET (4Q6C0309)
ONE OF THE NEW P. C.S OFFERS ALMOST DOUBLE THE MEMORY AND SLIGHTLY MORE STORAGE FOR ELEVEN %PERCENT LESS THAN THE COMPETING COMPAQ MACHINE (4Q6C030A)
I. B. M. P. C.S TRADITIONALLY ARE PRICED HIGHER THAN RIVAL BRANDS WHICH TYPICALLY MUST UNDERCUT I. B. M. PRICES BY FIFTEEN %PERCENT (4Q6C030B)
THE CENTRAL BANKS HAVE LITTLE CHANCE TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM THE DOLLAR'S FALL (4Q6C030C)
WHEN POSSIBLE THEY TRY TO REDUCE THEIR U. S. CURRENCY PORTFOLIOS BY SELLING DOLLARS BACK INTO CALMER MARKETS (4Q6C030D)
TRADERS SAY THE BUNDESBANK DID THIS WHEN THE DOLLAR STRENGTHENED IN LATE JULY AND EARLY AUGUST (4Q6C030E)

THERE ARE NO LAWYERS WHO FOCUS ONLY ON THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE LAW SAYS PROFESSOR MAEDA (4Q6C030I)
THERE JUST HAVEN'T BEEN ANY CASES (4Q6C030J)

GOING BACK TO OUR CHILDHOOD DAYS SHE ALWAYS LOVED NEW YORK AND EVERYTHING ABOUT IT THE MUSEUMS THE PARKS THE PEOPLE MS. TUCKERMAN SAID (4Q6C0402)
SHE WAS ALWAYS DRAWN BACK TO NEW YORK (4Q6C0403)
SHE CHOSE TO BRING UP HER CHILDREN IN THE CITY (4Q6C0404)

CARTER'S OPTIMISTIC AND UNQUALIFIED ASSESSMENTS OF STATEMENTS BY THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER KIM IL SUNG CONTRASTED WITH THE CAUTIOUS STAND TAKEN BY CLINTON ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS WHO HAVE BEEN CHASTENED BY A YEAR OF ON AGAIN OFF AGAIN DIPLOMACY WITH PYONGYANG (4Q6C0501)
THE CONTRAST ILLUSTRATES AN EMERGING PROBLEM FOR THE ADMINISTRATION IN BALANCING ITS FOREIGN POLICY AND POLITICAL CONCERNS (4Q6C0502)
ON ONE HAND CLINTON HAS USED CARTER'S DIPLOMACY AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO RELAX WASHINGTON'S CONDITIONS FOR HOLDING HIGH LEVEL TALKS WITH NORTH KOREA AND TO EXPLORE A DIPLOMATIC SETTLEMENT WHICH COULD HAVE THE IMMEDIATE BENEFIT OF PREVENTING THE NORTH FROM EXPANDING ITS NUCLEAR POTENTIAL (4Q6C0503)
ON THE OTHER HAND CARTER'S PORTRAYAL OF THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER AS AN HONEST STATESMAN COMMITTED TO A PEACEFUL RECONCILIATION WITH HIS NEIGHBORS HAS CREATED A RISK THAT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION WILL BE ASSOCIATED WITH AN INITIATIVE THAT CRITICS ARE ALREADY DERIDING AS NAIVE AND SIMPLISTIC (4Q6C0504)
IN REMARKS TO REPORTERS AT THE WHITE HOUSE SUNDAY AFTER THE MEETING CARTER WHO RETURNED FROM HIS TRIP LATE SATURDAY UNABASHEDLY PROVIDED AN ENCOURAGING AND UNQUALIFIED ACCOUNT OF HIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS (4Q6C0505)

IT'S VERY SAD FOR ME ALTHOUGH ALL OF US HAD KNOWN IT WAS COMING SAID BETTY PERCIVAL WHO'S SPENT TWENTY ONE YEARS AT THE PLANT IN ADMINISTRATIVE POSTS (4Q7C0204)
I ALMOST WISH I HADN'T SEEN THIS PART (4Q7C0205)
ON THE OTHER HAND I WOULDN'T HAVE LEFT EARLIER (4Q7C0206)

MORE THAN TWO DOZEN OTHER STRUCTURES EVENTUALLY WERE ADDED TO THE TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY ACRE SITE (4Q7C0208)
SOME OF THE BUILDINGS INCLUDING ONE THAT SERVED AS HOWARD HUGHES' PRIVATE APARTMENT ALREADY ARE EMPTY AND THE PLANT'S FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SPACE PARKING LOT IS DOTTED WITH WEEDS (4Q7C0209)

WE'LL LET THE COURTS DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR SHARES SAID MR. KLEIN (4Q7C0306)
BUT MS. LONG CAN'T FIND WORK AND THE PROGRAM WON'T HELP HER (4Q7C0307)
BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY TRAINED HER ONCE EIGHT YEARS AGO TO BE A TRUCK DRIVER THE LOCAL PROGRAM HAS REJECTED HER (4Q7C0308)
HER LAST JOB ENDED IN SEPTEMBER AND THE FORTY ONE YEAR OLD SINGLE MOTHER HAS APPLIED FOR DOZENS OF JOBS SINCE (4Q7C0309)
SHE HASN'T SOUGHT TO DRIVE A TRUCK BECAUSE SHE HASN'T DRIVEN ONE IN FIVE YEARS AND FEELS SHE IS NO LONGER QUALIFIED (4Q7C030A)
LUCKY STORES INCORPORATED SAID ITS BOARD APPROVED THE PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED REDEMPTION OF THIRTY EIGHT .POINT THREE MILLION STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS AT FIVE CENTS PER RIGHT (4Q7C030B)

DAYTON HUDSON SAID MR. SELLS WOULD HAVE AN IMPORTANT EQUITY POSITION IN THE COMPANY HE IS JOINING (4Q7C030E)
MR. SELLS WHO WASN'T AVAILABLE FOR COMMENT SAID IN A PREPARED STATEMENT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO RUN MY OWN COMPANY (4Q7C030F)
NOW I GET TO DO IT AND I'M VERY EXCITED (4Q7C030G)
LAWMAKERS AGREED THAT THE LAW'S ORIGINAL DEFICIT TARGETS WHICH WOULD HAVE SLASHED THE PROJECTED DEFICIT MORE THAN FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS WERE TOO SEVERE (4Q7C030H)
THE GRAMM RUDMAN PROPOSAL IS DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE ANNUAL FEDERAL DEFICIT TO ZERO IN FISCAL NINETEEN NINETY THREE RATHER THAN NINETEEN NINETY ONE UNDER THE ORIGINAL LAW (4Q7C030I)
FEW LAWMAKERS BELIEVE EVEN THAT GOAL WILL BE REACHED (4Q7C030J)
THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM IS IN ADDITION TO A SIX MILLION SHARE PROGRAM ANNOUNCED LAST YEAR (4Q7C030K)
REPURCHASE OF THE ENTIRE EIGHT MILLION SHARES WOULD RESULT IN THIRTY FOUR MILLION SHARES OUTSTANDING (4Q7C030L)
AMERITRUST SAID IT WOULD FINANCE THE REPURCHASE THROUGH INTERNAL FUNDS SHORT TERM BORROWINGS AND SOME OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF ITS INVESTMENT IN CENTRAL BANCORP (4Q7C030M)
KENT L. BARWICK PRESIDENT OF THE MUNICIPAL ART SOCIETY REMEMBERED THE DAY IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE WHEN MRS. ONASSIS CALLED HIM AND VOLUNTEERED TO JOIN WHAT THEN LOOKED LIKE A LOSING FIGHT TO SAVE THE TERMINAL FROM A PLAN TO PUT UP AN OFFICE TOWER THAT WOULD OBSCURE ITS FACADE (4Q7C0401)
JACKIE BROUGHT AN ENORMOUS VISIBILITY TO THE CAMPAIGN BARWICK RECALLED (4Q7C0402)
BY STANDING UP AND SPEAKING OUT FOR THE TERMINAL SHE MADE IT A SUCCESS (4Q7C0403)
AND SHE MADE IT NOT JUST A STRUGGLE INVOLVING NEW YORKERS BUT PEOPLE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY WHO SENT IN FIVE DOLLAR BILLS AND NOTES OF SUPPORT (4Q7C0404)
AT A CRUCIAL STAGE OF THE CAMPAIGN WHEN THE ISSUE RESTED BEFORE THE U. S. SUPREME COURT MRS. ONASSIS AND OTHER SUPPORTERS BOARDED A TRAIN TO WASHINGTON TO JOIN A PUBLIC DEMONSTRATION BARWICK SAID (4Q7C0405)
SHE GAVE IT SUCH RESPECTABILITY THAT SOME U. S. SENATORS JOINED IN (4Q7C0406)
LATER IN A MEETING WITH SEVERAL REPORTERS CARTER DESCRIBED THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER AS VIGOROUS AND INTELLIGENT (4Q7C0501)
HE TOLD ME HE WAS VERY GRATEFUL I HAD GONE AND THOUGHT IT WAS A VERY FINE ACCOMPLISHMENT CARTER SAID OF KIM (4Q7C0502)
BUT CARTER'S ACCOUNT TO REPORTERS OF TALKS SUGGESTED THAT SOME IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF THE NORTH'S POSITION STILL NEED TO BE CLARIFIED (4Q7C0503)
THE ESSENCE OF THE UNDERSTANDING THAT CARTER SAYS IS ALL BUT CONSUMMATED IS A NORTH KOREAN PROMISE TO FREEZE ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM IF WASHINGTON BEGINS HIGH LEVEL TALKS (4Q7C0504)
DURING THOSE TALKS THE NORTH KOREANS WOULD AGREE TO SHUT DOWN THEIR PLUTONIUM PRODUCING NUCLEAR COMPLEX IN YONGBYON (4Q7C0505)
IN RETURN THE NORTH KOREANS HAVE PROPOSED THAT THE WEST PROVIDE LIGHT WATER NUCLEAR REACTORS A TECHNOLOGY THAT IS LESS USEFUL IN PRODUCING PLUTONIUM WHICH IS USED TO MAKE NUCLEAR WEAPONS (4Q7C0506)
THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION HAS RESPONDED TO THE RECENT NORTH KOREAN MOVES THAT CARTER HAS DESCRIBED BY AGREEING TO HOLD THE HIGH LEVEL TALKS ON THREE CONDITIONS (4Q7C0507)
NEW YORK THE PHILIP MORRIS COMPANIES ANNOUNCED WEDNESDAY AFTER A MUCH ANTICIPATED MEETING OF ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS THAT IT WOULD TAKE NO ACTION FOR THE MOMENT ON SPLITTING ITS TOBACCO BUSINESS FROM ITS FOOD AND BEER OPERATIONS (4Q8C0201)
BUT THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED EXECUTIVE CHANGES THAT PROMPTED SOME ANALYSTS TO SPECULATE THAT SUCH A SPLIT MIGHT STILL BE IN THE OFFING (4Q8C0202)
COMPANY EXECUTIVES WOULD MAKE NO CLARIFICATION BEYOND A TERSELY WORDED PRESS RELEASE THAT RELEGATED INFORMATION ON THE BREAKUP TO A SINGLE SENTENCE (4Q8C0203)
BUT SOURCES CLOSE TO PHILIP MORRIS SAID THE COMPANY WOULD PROBABLY NOT TAKE UP THE ISSUE AGAIN AT THE NEXT SCHEDULED BOARD MEETING ON JUNE TWENTY NINTH (4Q8C0204)
WALL STREET HAD BEEN SPECULATING FOR WEEKS THAT A BREAKUP OF THE COMPANY WAS IMMINENT (4Q8C0205)
SOME ANALYSTS THOUGHT A DRAMATIC ACTION WAS NECESSARY TO PROP UP THE COMPANY'S DEPRESSED STOCK AND TO PROTECT THE PHILIP MORRIS FOOD OPERATIONS FROM POSSIBLE FUTURE LAWSUITS RELATED TO ITS TOBACCO OPERATIONS (4Q8C0206)
PHILIP MORRIS THE WORLD'S LARGEST CONSUMER PACKAGED GOODS COMPANY AND THE WORLD'S LARGEST TOBACCO COMPANY HAS BEEN BUFFETED BY PROPOSED INCREASES IN CIGARETTE TAXES PRICE CUTTING AND LEGAL THREATS INVOLVING HEALTH LIABILITY FROM SMOKING (4Q8C0207)
THE STOCK OF PHILIP MORRIS WHICH CLOSED AT FIFTY THREE DOLLARS AND SEVENTY FIVE CENTS ON TUESDAY NEVER OPENED FOR TRADING ON WEDNESDAY (4Q8C0208)
ACCORDING TO A SPOKESMAN FOR THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE THE OPENING WAS DELAYED BECAUSE OF AN ORDER IMBALANCE BUT BY TEN THIRTY FIVE A. M. THE EXCHANGE CHANGED THE REASON TO NEWS PENDING ALTHOUGH NOT BECAUSE OF A REQUEST BY THE COMPANY TO SUSPEND TRADING ACCORDING TO A COMPANY SPOKESWOMAN (4Q8C0209)
IN AFTER HOURS TRADING THE COMPANY'S STOCK FELL THREE DOLLARS AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS FROM TUESDAY'S CLOSING PRICE TO FIFTY DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS ACCORDING TO REUTERS (4Q8C020A)
THAT IS A FAR CRY FROM ITS PRICE OF SIXTY DOLLARS AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS IN FEBRUARY (4Q8C020B)
SOME ANALYSTS FOUND CLUES TO THE FUTURE OF THE COMPANY IN THE ACTION BY THE EIGHTEEN MEMBER BOARD (4Q8C020C)
PHILIP MORRIS ANNOUNCED THAT GEOFFREY C. BIBLE HAD BEEN ELECTED TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND PROMOTED TO VICE CHAIRMAN FOR WORLDWIDE TOBACCO (4Q8C020D)
PREVIOUSLY HE HAD BEEN VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNIT (4Q8C020E)
AND R. WILLIAM MURRAY WAS APPOINTED VICE CHAIRMAN FOR WORLDWIDE FOOD (4Q8C020F)
BOTH WILL REPORT TO MICHAEL A. MILES THE CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE (4Q8C020G)
THE FINANCIAL SERVICES CONCERN DIDN'T SPECIFY WHAT FIRST PERIOD RESULTS WERE (4Q8C0301)
THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS INCLUDED A SPECIAL CHARGE OF TWO .POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS OR TWENTY EIGHT CENTS A SHARE (4Q8C0302)
IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX FIRST QUARTER THE COMPANY EARNED FOUR .POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS OR FIFTY FOUR CENTS A SHARE (4Q8C0303)
THE MOST FREQUENT (4Q8C0304)
OF ALL SMALL BUSINESSES (4Q8C0305)
OFFICES THAT SELL BOTH REAL ESTATE AND INSURANCE ARE STARTED MORE OFTEN THAN RESTAURANTS (4Q8C0306)
DRY CLEANERS (4Q8C0307)
MAIL ORDER OPERATIONS (4Q8C0308)
THE AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE INDEX DROPPED ONE .POINT EIGHT SEVEN TO THREE HUNDRED SIX .POINT SIX TWO (4Q8C0309)
VOLUME TOTALED NINE MILLION ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND SHARES DOWN FROM TWELVE MILLION NINE HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND FRIDAY (4Q8C030A)
THERE WERE TWO HUNDRED EIGHTEEN ISSUES ADVANCING THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SIX DECLINING AND TWO HUNDRED SIXTY TWO UNCHANGED (4Q8C030B)
THE FINANCIAL TIMES THIRTY SHARE INDEX CLOSED EIGHT .POINT THREE POINTS HIGHER AT ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR .POINT FIVE (4Q8C030C)
VOLUME WAS A SLIGHT THREE HUNDRED FORTY TWO .POINT FOUR MILLION SHARES UP FROM THREE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE .POINT TWO MILLION A DAY EARLIER (4Q8C030D)
THE ONE HUNDRED SHARE INDEX CLOSED UP TEN .POINT FOUR POINTS AT EIGHTEEN FORTY FOUR .POINT THREE (4Q8C030E)
IT'S AT THE HIGH END OF OUR RANGE SAID RICHARD SHERLUND AN ANALYST WITH GOLDMAN SACHS AND COMPANY IN NEW YORK (4Q8C030F)
WE HAD PROJECTED SIXTY TO SIXTY FIVE CENTS A SHARE ON REVENUE OF ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS (4Q8C030G)
THIS CONTINUES THE STRONG PATTERN OF GROWTH THAT IS WELL ABOVE AVERAGE FOR THE INDUSTRY (4Q8C030H)
MOREOVER B. C. C. I. OFFICIALS AND INDUSTRY ANALYSTS STRESSED THAT AS MUCH AS SEVENTY FIVE %PERCENT OF THE BANK'S DEPOSIT BASE IS MADE UP OF RETAIL DEPOSITS (4Q8C030I)
THESE GENERALLY REACT MUCH LESS THAN LARGE DEPOSITORS TO REPORTS OF A SCANDAL (4Q8C030J)
IN ADDITION THE BANK HAS ALWAYS PURSUED A POLICY OF KEEPING ITS BALANCE SHEET RELATIVELY LIQUID INSIDERS AND COMPETITORS SAID (4Q8C030K)
BARWICK ALSO RECALLED HOW MRS. ONASSIS FOUGHT A PLAN TO CONSTRUCT A HUGE TOWER ON COLUMBUS CIRCLE ONE THAT WOULD CAST AN ENORMOUS SHADOW OVER CENTRAL PARK PLANS FOR THE BUILDING HAVE SINCE BEEN SCALED DOWN (4Q8C0401)
AND HE SAID SHE WAS INSTRUMENTAL A DECADE AGO IN PERSUADING LEGISLATORS IN ALBANY N. Y. TO BLOCK THE CONSTRUCTION OF AN OFFICE TOWER BESIDE SAINT BARTHOLOMEW'S CHURCH ON NEW YORK'S EAST SIDE (4Q8C0402)
JACKIE GOT ON THE TRAIN TO ALBANY MET WITH ASSEMBLYMEN AND SENATORS AND THE GOVERNOR ALL DAY GAVE TESTIMONY AND AT THE END OF THE DAY WHEN THE REST OF US WERE EXHAUSTED SHE STOOD FOR WELL OVER AN HOUR WHILE VIRTUALLY EVERY IMPORTANT LEGISLATOR HAD A PICTURE TAKEN WITH HER BARWICK REMEMBERED (4Q8C0403)
THE REVEREND GEORGE BARDES THE PASTOR OF SAINT THOMAS MORE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH WHO ADMINISTERED LAST RITES TO MRS. ONASSIS ON THURSDAY REMEMBERED HER AS A FAITHFUL PARISHIONER WHO QUIETLY ATTENDED SERVICES WITH HER FAMILY (4Q8C0404)
SHE WOULD USUALLY STOP AFTER MASS TO EXCHANGE PLEASANTRIES WITH THE PRIESTS HE SAID AND HE SPOKE OF THE SAD PASSING OF A WOMAN OF COURAGE (4Q8C0405)
THOSE CONDITIONS WHICH GALLUCCI RESTATED SUNDAY ARE THAT THE NORTH KOREANS REFRAIN FROM EXTRACTING ADDITIONAL PLUTONIUM FROM ITS REACTOR FUEL AGREE NOT TO REFUEL THEIR REACTOR AT YONGBYON AND ALLOW ADDITIONAL MONITORS TO REMAIN THERE (4Q8C0501)
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS DROPPED AN EARLIER CONDITION THAT NORTH KOREA TAKE STEPS NOW TO INSURE THAT MONITORS WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE FUTURE MEASUREMENTS TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH PLUTONIUM THE NORTH MIGHT HAVE DIVERTED FROM THE REACTOR IN PAST YEARS (4Q8C0502)
GALLUCCI INDICATED THAT AMERICAN OFFICIALS WOULD BE TALKING TO THEIR NORTH KOREAN COUNTERPARTS IN THE COMING DAYS TO TRY TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THE NORTH KOREANS ACCEPTED THE CONDITIONS (4Q8C0503)
THERE ARE SEVERAL POTENTIAL ISSUES TO CLARIFY (4Q8C0504)
CARTER TOLD REPORTERS FOR EXAMPLE THAT HE HAD NOT DISCUSSED THE ADMINISTRATION'S INSISTENCE THAT THE REACTOR NOT BE REFUELED BECAUSE THE MATTER HAD NOT BEEN MENTIONED DURING IN THE BRIEFINGS HE HAD RECEIVED FROM AMERICAN OFFICIALS BEFORE LEAVING FOR NORTH KOREA (4Q8C0505)
AND WHILE THE NORTH HAS SAID THAT INTERNATIONAL INSPECTORS CAN REMAIN AT ITS NUCLEAR COMPLEX AS LONG AS WASHINGTON IS MAKING GOOD FAITH EFFORTS TO RESOLVE THE CRISIS ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS WANT TO PIN DOWN THAT ASSURANCE (4Q8C0506)
SCHAUMBURG ILLINOIS SANTA FE PACIFIC CORPORATION SAID IT WILL OFFER SHARES IN ITS SANTA FE PACIFIC GOLD CORPORATION SUBSIDIARY AS A FIRST STEP TOWARD POSSIBLY SPINNING OFF THE MINING CONCERN (4Q9C0201)
IN A REGISTRATION STATEMENT FILED FRIDAY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION THE RAIL AND PIPELINE TRANSPORTATION COMPANY SAID IT WILL OFFER NEARLY FIFTEEN %PERCENT OF THE ALBUQUERQUE NEW MEXICO SUBSIDIARY TO THE PUBLIC (4Q9C0202)
FOLLOWING A SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE OFFERING THE COMPANY SAID ITS MANAGEMENT AND BOARD WOULD REVIEW DISTRIBUTING THE REMAINING SHARES IN THE GOLD SUBSIDIARY TO THE PARENT COMPANY'S SHAREHOLDERS (4Q9C0203)
SANTA FE SAID IT HAS RECEIVED A RULING FROM THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE THAT SUCH A DISTRIBUTION WOULDN'T HAVE TO BE RECOGNIZED AS INCOME BY THE COMPANY OR BY ITS SHAREHOLDERS (4Q9C0204)
THE OFFERING OF EIGHTEEN MILLION SHARES TWELVE MILLION IN THE U. S. AND SIX MILLION OUTSIDE THIS COUNTRY WILL BE PRICED BETWEEN THIRTEEN DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS AND FIFTEEN DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS A SHARE (4Q9C0205)
PROCEEDS WILL BE USED TO PAY DOWN THE GOLD SUBSIDIARY'S BANK DEBT (4Q9C0206)
ANY PROCEEDS RAISED IN EXCESS OF THAT AMOUNT WILL BE USED FOR WORKING CAPITAL OR TO PAY DOWN OTHER DEBTS (4Q9C0207)
AFTER THE OFFERING SANTA FE PACIFIC CORPORATION WILL OWN ABOUT EIGHTY SIX .POINT TWO %PERCENT OR ONE HUNDRED TWELVE .POINT TWO MILLION SHARES OF THE MINING AND PROCESSING COMPANY (4Q9C0208)
SANTA FE RECEIVED THE MINING OPERATIONS LAST JUNE AFTER SWAPPING ITS COAL ASSETS FOR THE GOLD ASSETS OF HANSON NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY (4Q9C0209)
FOLLOWING THE EXCHANGE SANTA FE RENAMED THE MINERALS SUBSIDIARY SANTA FE GOLD CORPORATION (4Q9C020A)

OPERATING PROFIT WAS EIGHTY SIX .POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS (4Q9C020C)

CATERPILLAR INCORPORATED SAYS IT GENERALLY GIVES A YEAR OR MORE NOTICE OF CLOSINGS (4Q9C0301)
LAYOFFS THOUGH ARE ANOTHER MATTER (4Q9C0302)
WE WOULD HAVE TO DELAY ANY CHANGE IN PRODUCTION SCHEDULES OR ELSE HAVE PEOPLE SITTING AROUND DOING NOTHING A SPOKESMAN SAYS (4Q9C0303)
BUT A UNITED AUTO WORKERS OFFICIAL SAYS THAT ADVANCE NOTICE IS POSSIBLE FOR MAJOR LAYOFFS (4Q9C0304)
THE ONLY REASON COMPANIES DON'T WANT TO ANNOUNCE IT IS IT MAY HURT THEIR STOCK PRICE HE CONTENDS (4Q9C0305)
NEWS THAT SUCH A LARGE SALOMON STAKE MAY BE FOR SALE WASN'T WELL RECEIVED BY SOME SALOMON STAFF MEMBERS WHO FEARED THAT SALOMON COULD BE VULNERABLE TO A TAKEOVER (4Q9C0306)
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED TO SEE SOMEONE TAKE A RUN AT US SAID ONE SALOMON MANAGER (4Q9C0307)
BUT MARKET ANALYSTS SAID A TAKEOVER OF SALOMON WAS HIGHLY UNLIKELY EVEN WITH THE FIRM'S DEPRESSED STOCK PRICE (4Q9C0308)
DEATH IS THE KEY WORD SAID ONE INDIVIDUAL FAMILIAR WITH I. C. N. (4Q9C0309)
THERE ARE SOME KEY SHARES IN SOME VERY AGED HANDS AND THE FATE OF THIS COMPANY HINGES ON THESE SHARES (4Q9C030A)
I DON'T THINK ANYONE COULD BUY THEM TODAY BUT THINGS CHANGE WHEN PEOPLE DIE (4Q9C030B)
INVESTIGATORS ARE LOOKING INTO FACTORS OTHER THAN WEATHER IN THE DENVER CRASH OF A CONTINENTAL AIRLINES JET SUNDAY IN WHICH TWENTY SEVEN WERE KILLED AND FIFTY FIVE HURT (4Q9C030C)
WITNESSES SAID THE JET VEERED BEFORE A WING HIT THE GROUND (4Q9C030D)
SEPARATELY HEARINGS BEGAN INTO THE AUGUST SIXTEENTH CRASH OF A NORTHWEST AIRLINES JET THAT KILLED ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX NEAR DETROIT (4Q9C030E)
PACIFIC INCOME TRUST WAS THE BEST PERFORMER OF ALL FUNDS OVER FIVE YEARS TURNING IN AN IMPRESSIVE GAIN OF ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN %PERCENT (4Q9C030F)
THE FUND USES AN UNUSUAL STRATEGY OF INVESTING IN CONVERTIBLE BONDS (4Q9C030G)
THE BONDS OFFER RELATIVELY HIGH YIELDS AND WHEN THE SHARE PRICE IS FAVORABLE CAN BE CONVERTED TO COMMON STOCK TO TAKE CAPITAL GAINS (4Q9C030H)
THERE ARE TWO ISSUES TO CONSIDER (4Q9C030I)
FIRST WHAT WAS ADMIRAL POINDEXTER'S BELIEF ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S POLICY OF HELPING THE NICARAGUAN DEMOCRATIC RESISTANCE (4Q9C030J)
SECOND DID ADMIRAL POINDEXTER BELIEVE WHAT HE AND COLONEL NORTH WERE DOING WAS LEGAL (4Q9C030K)
PRESIDENT CLINTON AND HIS WIFE HILLARY WILL ATTEND THE BURIAL OF JACQUELINE KENNEDY ONASSIS AT ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY ON MONDAY AFTERNOON BUT A SPOKESMAN SAID ON SATURDAY THAT CLINTON WOULD NOT GO TO HER FUNERAL SERVICE IN NEW YORK (4Q9C0401)
GINNY TERZANO A WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN SAID THAT THE PRESIDENT WOULD NOT ATTEND THE MONDAY MORNING SERVICE AT SAINT IGNATIUS LOYOLA ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH ON PARK AVENUE AT EAST EIGHTY FOURTH STREET OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE FAMILY'S WISH THAT THE SERVICE BE SMALL AND PRIVATE (4Q9C0402)
BUT A WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL SAID IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT MRS. CLINTON WOULD ATTEND THE NEW YORK SERVICE (4Q9C0403)
OUTSIDE MRS. ONASSIS'S APARTMENT BUILDING ON FIFTH AVENUE AT EAST EIGHTY FIFTH STREET WHERE SHE DIED OF CANCER THURSDAY NIGHT HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE CONTINUED TO MILL ABOUT ON SATURDAY PRESSED AGAINST POLICE BARRICADES WAITING (4Q9C0404)
A FEW FAMILY MEMBERS AND CLOSE FRIENDS HURRIED IN AND OUT FROM TIME TO TIME (4Q9C0405)
MRS. ONASSIS'S DAUGHTER CAROLINE KENNEDY SCHLOSSBERG ARRIVED SHORTLY AFTER ELEVEN A. M. WITH HER HUSBAND EDWIN AND THEIR THREE SMALL CHILDREN (4Q9C0406)
THE ACTRESS DARRYL HANNAH A FREQUENT COMPANION OF JOHN F. KENNEDY JUNIOR LEFT WITH AN UNIDENTIFIED MAN AND WAS PURSUED BY PHOTOGRAPHERS AND CAMERAMEN UP EAST EIGHTY FIFTH STREET BACK DOWN THE STREET AND OUT ONTO PARK AVENUE WHERE THEY DOVE INTO A PASSING TAXI (4Q9C0407)
ANOTHER IMPORTANT QUESTION PERTAINS TO WHAT MIGHT BE AGREED UPON AT THE HIGH LEVEL TALKS (4Q9C0501)
THE WHITE HOUSE INSISTS THAT AS PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE SETTLEMENT IT WANTS TO RESOLVE THE QUESTION OF HOW MUCH PLUTONIUM NORTH KOREA MIGHT HAVE DIVERTED IN PAST YEARS (4Q9C0502)
CARTER TOLD REPORTERS THAT THE NORTH KOREANS SAID THEY HAD DEVISED A WAY TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE THROUGH TECHNICAL MEANS (4Q9C0503)
BUT THE METHOD THEY HAVE DESCRIBED TO THE INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY HAS BEEN DEEMED INADEQUATE BY THE AGENCY (4Q9C0504)
THERE ARE ALSO IMPORTANT QUESTIONS ABOUT THE AMERICAN POSITION INCLUDING WHICH NATIONS MIGHT BE PREPARED TO PROVIDE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN ASSISTANCE TO REPLACE THE NORTH KOREA'S NUCLEAR APPARATUS WITH NEW LIGHT WATER REACTORS (4Q9C0505)
DESPITE THE AREAS OF AMBIGUITY ON THE NUCLEAR ISSUE CARTER INSISTED THAT THERE WERE NO UNANSWERED QUESTIONS ON THE CENTRAL ISSUE OF NORTH KOREA'S DESIRE TO RESOLVE THE MATTER (4Q9C0506)
HE SAID HE WOULD CONFIRM IN WRITING HIS UNDERSTANDING OF THE NORTH'S POSITION CONFIRM IT WITH THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER AND SHARE IT WITH AMERICAN OFFICIALS (4Q9C0507)
THE NEXT STEP WOULD BE FOR AMERICAN OFFICIALS TO CONFIRM THE UNDERSTANDING IN THEIR TALKS WITH THE NORTH KOREANS (4Q9C0508)
TIRED OF PAYING A FOUR PERCENT OR FIVE PERCENT UPFRONT COMMISSION WHEN YOU BUY A MUTUAL FUND FROM YOUR BROKER (4QBC0201)
WEARY OF WORRYING ABOUT WITHDRAWAL CHARGES IF YOU WANT TO LEAVE YOUR FUND BEFORE YOU'VE BEEN IN THERE FOR FIVE OR SIX YEARS (4QBC0202)
IF SO I'VE GOT SOME GOOD NEWS FOR YOU (4QBC0203)
THE MUTUAL FUND INDUSTRY IS QUICKLY MARCHING DOWN THE PATH TO A NEW KIND OF FUND SHARE CALLED THE C. SHARE OR LEVEL LOAD SHARE (4QBC0204)
WHEN YOU BUY A LEVEL LOAD SHARE YOU DON'T PAY AN UPFRONT COMMISSION OR FACE A WITHDRAWAL CHARGE (4QBC0205)
INSTEAD YOU SIMPLY PAY THE FUND AN ANNUAL FEE OF ONE PERCENT (4QBC0206)
THE NEW C. SHARES JOIN TWO OLDER TYPES OF BROKER SOLD FUND SHARES NOW CALLED A. AND B. SHARES (4QBC0207)
TO COUNTER GROWING CONFUSION ABOUT FUND SHARES THE INDUSTRY RECENTLY DESIGNATED SHARES AS CLASS A. B. C. OR D. DEPENDING ON THE SALES CHARGES AND FEES INVOLVED (4QBC0208)
THE A. SHARE WHICH IS THE TRADITIONAL FRONT END LOAD SHARE COMES WITH THE UNNERVING SIGHT OF A BROKER SLICING OFF A FOUR OR FIVE PERCENT COMMISSION BEFORE MONEY IS EVEN INVESTED (4QBC0209)
THE B. SHARES WERE CREATED TO AVOID THAT PAIN AND TO ALLOW AN INVESTOR TO KEEP HIS OR HER ORIGINAL INVESTMENT INTACT (4QBC020A)
THE B. SHARES HOWEVER HAVE EARLY WITHDRAWAL CHARGES AND SO CALLED TWELVE B. ONE FEES USED TO PAY BROKERS' COMMISSIONS (4QBC020B)
THE COSTS OF A. AND B. SHARES TEND TO EVEN OUT AFTER EIGHT YEARS (4QBC020C)
THE EMERGENCE OF C. SHARES ACCORDING TO FUND EXECUTIVES RECOGNIZES THAT MANY INVESTORS STILL RESIST PAYING COMMISSIONS TO BUY MUTUAL FUNDS (4QBC020D)
C. SHARES THUS CHARGE ONLY AN ANNUAL FEE (4QBC020E)
THE BIGGEST ADVANTAGE OF C. SHARES IS THAT THEY GIVE INVESTORS THE FREEDOM TO CHANGE THEIR MINDS ABOUT WHERE THEY WANT TO KEEP THEIR MONEY WITHOUT PAYING A PENALTY (4QBC020F)
ANY INVESTOR WHO TENDS TO BE UNCERTAIN ABOUT HIS OR HER FUND INVESTMENTS WILL UNDERSTAND HOW COMFORTING IT IS TO HAVE THAT FREEDOM (4QBC020G)

ADULT TICKET PRICES ARE UP ABOUT FIVE .POINT FIVE %PERCENT FROM A YEAR AGO A DISNEY SPOKESMAN SAID (4QBC030C)
TWO FOR THE MOMENT HOWEVER THE BIGGEST PROBLEM FOR FAMILY BUSINESS OWNERS IS THE UNCERTAINTY OVER WHAT TO DO WHILE WAITING TO SEE IF THE PROPOSAL BECOMES LAW (4QBC030D)
AND IF IT DOES IT IS UNCLEAR JUST WHEN THE NEW PROVISIONS WOULD TAKE EFFECT (4QBC030E)
THE LEGISLATION ITSELF INDICATES THE DATE WOULD BE DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST BUT A CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE REPORT SAYS OCTOBER THIRTEENTH (4QBC030F)
IN JANUARY THE BEAVERTON OREGON TOY MAKER DISCLOSED TALKS CONCERNING ITS POSSIBLE TAKEOVER BY A THIRD PARTY WHO PROPOSED A FRIENDLY TRANSACTION (4QBC030G)
BUT THE DISCUSSIONS SUBSEQUENTLY ENDED BECAUSE THE TWO SIDES COULDN'T AGREE ON FINANCIAL AND OTHER TERMS (4QBC030H)
AT THE TIME THE COMPANY SAID IT WOULD EXPLORE OTHER OPTIONS (4QBC030I)
THE THIRD PARTY WASN'T IDENTIFIED (4QBC030J)
MORTGAGES OF FOUR %PERCENT (4QBC030K)
YOU HAVE TO GO ALL THE WAY BACK TO NINETEEN FIFTY ONE TO FIND RATES THAT LOW (4QBC030L)
BUT IF THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT HAS ITS WAY LENDERS MAY BE OFFERING HOME LOANS AT SUCH LOW INITIAL RATES BY YEAR END (4QBC030M)

WHEN J. F. K.'S BIER PASSED BY SHE GENTLY NUDGED HER THREE YEAR OLD SON JOHN JOHN TO SALUTE THE FALLEN COMMANDER IN CHIEF (4QBC0404)
THROUGHOUT SHE SLEPT LITTLE AND IN PUBLIC WEPT NOT AT ALL (4QBC0405)

A FEW DAYS AFTER THE FUNERAL SHE SUMMONED HISTORIAN THEODORE H. WHITE WHO WAS WRITING A EULOGY FOR LIFE MAGAZINE (4QBC0407)
SHE TOLD HIM THAT SHE BELIEVED AND THAT HER HUSBAND BELIEVED THAT HISTORY BELONGS TO HEROES AND THAT HEROES MUST NOT BE FORGOTTEN (4QBC0408)
GRANTED IT WAS NOT A MASTERPIECE OF CLARITY AND COORDINATION (4QBC0501)
BUT FORMER PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER AND THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION WHICH APPROVED HIS TRIP APPEAR TO HAVE MOVED THE CRISIS OVER THE NORTH KOREAN NUCLEAR PROGRAM BACK TOWARD THE NEGOTIATING TABLE (4QBC0502)
CARTER'S PERSONAL DIPLOMACY CONDUCTED WITH NORTH KOREAN PRESIDENT KIM IL SUNG MAY WELL PROVIDE A FACE SAVING WAY FOR BOTH SIDES TO PULL BACK FROM CONFRONTATION (4QBC0503)
CARTER SAYS HE WON KIM'S CONSENT TO FREEZE HIS NUCLEAR PROGRAM IN A VERIFIABLE WAY WHILE HIGH LEVEL TALKS ARE RESUMED BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND NORTH KOREA TO RESOLVE THE NUCLEAR ISSUE (4QBC0504)
IF THE SPECIFICS OF THE KOREAN OFFER ARE CONFIRMED IT OFFERS A PROMISING ROUTE TOWARD A DEAL (4QBC0505)
THE FORMER PRESIDENT ALSO WON KIM'S ASSENT TO A MEETING WITH SOUTH KOREA'S PRESIDENT AN OFFER THAT THE SOUTH HAS WELCOMED (4QBC0506)
IF THE TALKS TAKE PLACE THEY COULD FURTHER DEFUSE THE CRISIS ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA (4QBC0507)
TRUE CARTER ERRED IN SAYING THAT THE U. S. WOULD SUSPEND EFFORTS TO SEEK U. N. ENDORSEMENT OF SANCTIONS PRESIDENT CLINTON HAD CONDITIONED THAT SUSPENSION ON CONFIRMATION BY NORTH KOREA OF ITS NUCLEAR FREEZE (4QBC0508)
BUT SANCTIONS WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO MOUNT EFFECTIVELY AT THIS POINT ANYWAY (4QBC0509)
JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA NEVER MIND CHINA AND RUSSIA ARE UNLIKELY TO MOVE TO SANCTIONS WHILE THERE IS A CHANCE FOR DIPLOMACY (4QBC050A)
TOUGH SANCTIONS COULD BRING DOWN JAPAN'S COALITION GOVERNMENT AND RAISE RISKS OF WAR THAT SOUTH KOREA DOES NOT CARE TO RUN (4QBC050B)
ANYONE TRYING TO SELL YOU A BOND NOWADAYS WILL TELL YOU THAT THE RECENT JUMP IN LONG TERM INTEREST RATES IS A FALSE ALARM AT LEAST AS FAR AS INFLATION IS CONCERNED (4QCC0201)

IN SANTA MONICA CALIFORNIA WELL KNOWN HEDGE FUND MANAGER MARK STROME BELIEVES METALS SUCH AS COPPER NICKEL AND ALUMINUM ARE POISED FOR DRAMATIC PRICE RISES (4QCC0209)
I THINK THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY IN FINANCIAL MARKETS IN NINETY FOUR HE SAYS (4QCC020A)
BUT FOR METALS PRICES TO SURGE STROME CONCEDES REAL DEMAND FROM BUSIER FACTORIES CHURNING OUT MORE GOODS WILL HAVE TO BE THERE WORLDWIDE (4QCC020B)
ROBERT GENETSKI WHO RUNS A CHICAGO BASED ECONOMIC ADVISORY FIRM BEARING HIS NAME PREDICTS THAT THE NUMBER ONE SURPRISE THIS YEAR WILL BE A STRONGER U. S. ECONOMY THAN WALL STREET NOW FORESEES (4QCC020C)
THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD GENETSKI ARGUES ALLOWED MONEY TO BE SO LOOSE FOR SO LONG NINETEEN NINETY ONE TO NINETEEN NINETY THREE THAT THE SEEDS OF ROBUST FUTURE BUSINESS AND CONSUMER SPENDING ARE ALREADY SOWN (4QCC020D)
WHILE THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM IS THAT THE FED'S CREDIT TIGHTENING MOVES THIS YEAR WILL SLOW THE ECONOMY GENETSKI POINTS TO THE SURGE IN BANK LOAN DEMAND FROM BUSINESS BORROWERS IN RECENT MONTHS AS EVIDENCE THAT THE ECONOMIC EXPANSION IS GAINING STEAM NOT LOSING IT (4QCC020E)
COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS OUTSTANDING WHICH PLUNGED FROM NINETEEN NINETY ONE THROUGH NINETY THREE HAVE JUMPED TO SIX HUNDRED AND FIVE BILLION DOLLARS NOW FROM FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE BILLION AT JANUARY FIRST EVEN AS RATES HAVE INCREASED (4QCC020F)

ONE OPTION OFFERS MORE CASH PER SHARE BUT FOR FEWER SHARES (4QCC030H)
THE OTHER SEEKS THE ENTIRE NINETY %PERCENT STAKE IN U. S. G. THAT DESERT PARTNERS DOESN'T ALREADY OWN BUT HEAVILY INCREASES THE DEBT PORTION OF THE BID (4QCC030I)
I DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA WHETHER A RECESSION IS AROUND THE CORNER (4QCC030J)
BUT SOME ECONOMISTS THINK THAT ONE IS IMPENDING OR MAY EVEN HAVE STARTED (4QCC030K)
IN ANY CASE IT IS A GOOD BET THAT THERE WILL BE A RECESSION SOMETIME (4QCC030L)
AT NIGHT SHE SAID J. F. K. LIKED TO LISTEN TO A RECORDING OF THE LERNER AND LOWE MUSICAL AND HE IDENTIFIED WITH THE WORDS OF THE LAST SONG DON'T LET IT BE FORGOT THAT ONCE THERE WAS A SPOT FOR ONE BRIEF SHINING MOMENT THAT WAS KNOWN AS CAMELOT (4QCC0401)
WHITE KNEW PERFECTLY WELL THAT JACKIE WAS MISREADING HISTORY BUT HE WAS MESMERIZED BY THE ROMANCE AND PASSION IN HER BREATHY VOICE (4QCC0402)
AT THAT MOMENT HE LATER WROTE SHE COULD HAVE SOLD ME ANYTHING FROM AN EDSEL TO THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE (4QCC0403)
ALL SHE WAS REALLY ASKING FOR HE RATIONALIZED WAS FOR ME TO HANG THIS LIFE EPILOGUE ON THE CAMELOT CONCEIT (4QCC0404)
IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE A HELL OF A LOT (4QCC0405)
SO I SAID TO MYSELF WHY NOT (4QCC0406)

SHE ALWAYS KNEW WHAT SHE WANTED AND HOW TO GO ABOUT GETTING IT SAYS NOVELIST LOUIS AUCHINCLOSS AN OLD FRIEND FROM CHILDHOOD DAYS (4QCC040A)
SOMEHOW SHE MANAGED TO BE GENTEEL GRACIOUS DIGNIFIED EVEN AS SHE WAS SHREWD AND FIERCE (4QCC040B)
THE PROMISES CARTER SAYS HE HAS WON FROM NORTH KOREA WOULD GO A LONG WAY TOWARD MEETING CONDITIONS SET BY THE ADMINISTRATION FOR HOLDING HIGH LEVEL TALKS WITH THE NORTH (4QCC0501)
ONE CONDITION HAS NECESSARILY BEEN ABANDONED (4QCC0502)
NORTH KOREA'S ABRUPT REMOVAL OF FUEL RODS FROM ITS REACTOR AT YONGBYON BARRED INTERNATIONAL INSPECTORS FROM THEIR PREFERRED WAY OF DETERMINING WHETHER THE NORTH DIVERTED ENOUGH SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE TO YIELD A BOMB'S WORTH OR MORE OF PLUTONIUM (4QCC0503)
SO OTHER WAYS MUST NOW BE FOUND A MAJOR ISSUE FOR THE HIGH LEVEL TALKS (4QCC0504)
BUT AN EVEN MORE IMPORTANT CONDITION WAS MET WHEN KIM GAVE CARTER HIS PERSONAL PLEDGE THAT THE INSPECTORS COULD REMAIN AT YONGBYON THUS PREVENTING DIVERSION OF AN ADDITIONAL FIVE BOMBS' WORTH OF PLUTONIUM (4QCC0505)
IN THE MEANTIME NORTH KOREA NEEDS TO DEFER LOADING THE REACTOR WITH NEW FUEL RODS THAT COULD BE AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE DIVERSION AN ISSUE THAT CARTER DID NOT RAISE WITH THE NORTH (4QCC0506)
ONCE WASHINGTON CONFIRMS THAT A FREEZE IS IN EFFECT HIGH LEVEL TALKS CAN RESUME AND PREPARATIONS FOR ECONOMIC SANCTIONS CAN HALT (4QCC0507)
THE U. S. WILL THEN SEEK A VERIFIABLE END TO THE NORTH'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM ESPECIALLY ITS CAPACITY FOR REPROCESSING SPENT FUEL AND AN END TO THE NORTH'S MISSILE EXPORTS (4QCC0508)

THE CONFERENCE DEBATE WAS DOMINATED BY THE WILD SWINGS IN BOND MARKETS THIS YEAR TRIGGERED PARTLY BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD'S DECISION TO INCREASE INTEREST RATES IN FEBRUARY AND BY SPECULATION THAT CENTRAL BANKS MAY CLAMP DOWN ON DERIVATIVES (4QDC020A)
THESE PRODUCTS AT ONE STAGE REMOVED FROM THE TRADITIONAL CASH MARKETS TYPICALLY ALLOW BANKS TO TAKE OUT OPTIONS OR TO SWAP CONTRACTS (4QDC020B)

AIRLINES SAY AIRSPACE HAS BECOME SO CROWDED IN EUROPE THAT ANY AIRLINE MISSING AN ASSIGNED TAKEOFF SLOT MAY HAVE TO WAIT AN HOUR FOR ANOTHER FREE SLOT (4RKC030N)
EACH COUNTRY IN EUROPE ALSO OPERATES ITS OWN AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL SYSTEM AND THIS MAKES THE ENTIRE EUROPEAN AIR SYSTEM VULNERABLE TO THE CONTINENT'S FREQUENT AIR CONTROLLER STRIKES (4RKC030O)
TWO WEEKS AGO FOR INSTANCE A WEEKEND STRIKE BY ENGINEERS WHO CONTROL AIRPLANES IN FLIGHT OVER FRANCE CAUSED HORRENDOUS BACKUPS ON BRITISH FLIGHTS HEADING THROUGH FRENCH AIRSPACE (4RKC030P)

MR. MEESE ANNOUNCED THE DIVERSION WAS UP TO THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS (4RKC040B)
THE CORRECT FIGURE TURNED OUT TO BE ABOUT THREE MILLION DOLLARS BUT THIS WAS A COMPARATIVELY SMALL MISTAKE (4RKC040C)
THE BIG PROBLEM WAS THAT IN ITS HASTE TO RUSH THE STORY OUT THE WHITE HOUSE NEVER THOUGHT THROUGH ITS OWN POLITICAL LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL POSITION (4RKC040D)
OF COURSE THE ADMINISTRATION HAD MADE MISTAKES AND NOW HAD TO GET THE STORY OUT (4RKC040E)
BUT IT DIDN'T NEED TO ROLL OVER (4RKC040F)
FOLLOWING THE BASIC LINE WORKED OUT AT THE WHITE HOUSE MR. MEESE USED THE NEWS CONFERENCE TO PORTRAY OLLIE NORTH AS RASPUTIN TO A HAPLESS PRESIDENT (4RKC040G)
SO STRANGE IS THE SITUATION THAT ONE HOLLY DIRECTOR HAS PROPOSED CHANGING THE COMPANY'S NAME TO FANTASY SUGAR COMPANY (4RKC040H)
HE SAYS THAT COULD ENTICE SHAMROCK BECAUSE OF ITS DISNEY CONNECTION TO BUY THE COMPANY (4RKC040I)
JUST THINK OF HOW MUCH THEY COULD MAKE ON THE MOVIE RIGHTS HE ADDS (4RKC040J)
K. MART AND BRUNO'S SAID THEIR HYPERMARKETS WHICH HAVEN'T BEEN NAMED YET WILL INCLUDE SPECIALTY SHOPS (4RKC040K)

LOCATED IN MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREAS THEY WILL BE TOTALLY DISTINCT FROM THE CURRENT OPERATIONS OF BOTH COMPANIES A PREPARED STATEMENT SAID (4RKC040M)
THE FIRST IS EXPECTED TO OPEN NEXT YEAR (4RKC040N)
I HAVE NO DOUBT THOUGH THAT THE THRUST OF FED POLICY WILL BE MORE TOWARD EASE THAN RESTRAINT MR. ROBERTSON ADDS (4RKC040O)
FED OFFICIALS WILL BE MUCH MORE INCLINED TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF EASE (4RKC040P)
SO I THINK THE FED FUNDS RATE WILL BE AT SIX .POINT FIVE OH %PERCENT TO SIX .POINT SEVEN FIVE %PERCENT FOR THE NEXT SIXTY DAYS (4RKC040Q)

A VERY SIMILAR CASE OCCURRED WITH ANOTHER NATIONAL RETAILER THAT SOUGHT TO REDUCE ITS OVERHEAD AND OPERATING EXPENSES (4RLC060K)
ANOTHER LARGE CLASS ACTION SUIT ALSO BASED ON THE CHARGE OF AGE DISCRIMINATION IS PENDING AGAINST A LEADING MIDWESTERN BANK (4RLC060L)
IT IS OUR ROLE IN THE STRUGGLE AS A CHRISTIAN ORGANIZATION TO SHOW THAT THE FREEDOM CHARTER IS NOT A COMMUNIST DOCUMENT HE SAYS (4RLC060M)
THE FREEDOM CHARTER SAYS EXACTLY WHAT JESUS SAID (4RLC060N)
IT IS CLEAR JESUS WAS ON THE SIDE OF THE POOR OF THE OPPRESSED (4RLC060O)
THUS LESLEY ASKS CAN THERE BE ANY DOUBT THAT JESUS IS ALSO ON THE SIDE OF THE A. N. C. (4RLC060P)
FRANKFURT SHARE PRICES RETREATED ACROSS THE BOARD IN MODERATELY ACTIVE TRADING AS THE DAY EARLIER DECLINE ON WALL STREET AND WEAKER DOLLAR PROMPTED WIDESPREAD PROFIT TAKING (4RLC060Q)
BUT EQUITIES RECOVERED SOME OF THEIR EARLIER LOSSES LATE IN THE SESSION AND MOST PRICES CLOSED ONLY SLIGHTLY LOWER (4RLC060R)
THE MARKET'S BULLISH MOMENTUM IS STILL INTACT TRADERS SAID CITING A FLURRY OF LATE BUY ORDERS (4RLC060S)
WHAT POSSIBLE EFFECT THE VARIANT C. D. FOUR COULD HAVE ON GENENTECH'S COMPETITIVE POSITION OR PATENT POSITION IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT (4RLC060T)
MARK RATNER BIOTECHNOLOGY'S SENIOR EDITOR FOR FINANCIAL COVERAGE SPECULATES IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S AMENDABLE WITHOUT PREJUDICE (4RLC060U)
BESIDES HE ADDS THE WRONG MOLECULE COULD WORK AS WELL AS THE RIGHT MOLECULE (4RLC060V)
UNTIL IT GOES THROUGH TRIALS NO ONE KNOWS (4RLC060W)
NOW QUICK RECOGNITION OF LOSSES IS NOT ONLY GOOD INVESTMENT STRATEGY BUT GOOD ECONOMIC STRATEGY (4RLC060X)
FULL DEDUCTIBILITY WOULD PROMOTE MOBILITY OF CAPITAL AND EFFICIENT PRICING OF ASSETS (4RLC060Y)
IT WOULD OBVIOUSLY PROMOTE MORE VENTURE CAPITAL WITH HIGH GAINS AND HIGH RISKS (4RLC060Z)
MERE INDEXING BY CONTRAST WOULD HELP THE BIG AND DULL INVESTMENTS WITH LOW RISKS AND HUMDRUM REWARDS (4RLC0610)
BUT IF FULL DEDUCTIBILITY OF LOSSES WOULD BE GOOD FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH IT WOULD BE BAD IN TWO OTHER WAYS (4RLC0611)
AS A RULE CHIEF EXECUTIVES STEER CLEAR OF SUCH GATHERINGS TO AVOID ANY SUGGESTION OF IMPROPRIETY (4RLC0612)
IN THE PAST TRADE ASSOCIATIONS OR MORE INFORMAL GATHERINGS OF INDUSTRY EXECUTIVES HAVE BEEN VEHICLES FOR COLLUSION ON MATTERS RANGING FROM PRICES TO CREDIT TERMS (4RLC0613)
MOST FORMAL TRADE ASSOCIATIONS SUCH AS THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CHAIN DRUG STORES ARE CAREFUL TO STEER CLEAR OF SUCH ISSUES (4RLC0614)
ON THE CORPORATE FRONT A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ISSUE OF ETHYL CORPORATION SINKING FUND DEBENTURES WAS OFFERED TO INVESTORS THROUGH UNDERWRITERS LED BY FIRST BOSTON CORPORATION (4RMC0201)
THE NINE AND THREE EIGHTHS %PERCENT ISSUE WAS PRICED AT NINETY NINE .POINT FIFTY FIVE TO YIELD NINE .POINT FORTY TWO %PERCENT TO MATURITY IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN (4RMC0202)
IT IS RATED SINGLE A. TWO BY MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE INCORPORATED AND TRIPLE B. PLUS BY STANDARD AND POOR'S CORPORATION (4RMC0203)
FEW OBSERVERS ARE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE COURT'S OTHER PROBLEMS (4RMC0204)
ACCORDING TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES OF THE UNITED STATES COURTS ONLY HALF OF THE FIFTY BANKRUPTCY JUDGES WHOSE TERMS EXPIRE BY NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WILL RETURN (4RMC0205)
THE AGENCY ALSO PREDICTS THAT THE NUMBER OF BANKRUPTCY FILINGS WILL RISE SEVENTEEN %PERCENT IN THE YEAR ENDING SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN (4RMC0206)
SHEARSON LEHMAN BROTHERS INCORPORATED'S INDEX OF LONG TERM TREASURY BONDS FELL ELEVEN .POINT SEVENTY FIVE POINTS TO CLOSE AT FOURTEEN OH TWO .POINT EIGHTY FOUR (4RMC0207)
AT ONE POINT THE INDEX SANK TO THIRTEEN NINETY NINE .POINT SIXTY FOUR THE LOWEST LEVEL SINCE NOVEMBER SEVENTEEN (4RMC0208)
THE INDEX'S HIGHEST LEVEL YESTERDAY WAS FOURTEEN TEN .POINT THIRTY NINE (4RMC0209)
N. R. M.'S PUBLIC OFFERING COMPRISED ABOUT NINE MILLION SO CALLED ACQUISITION PREFERRED UNITS CONVERTIBLE INTO FORTY NINE MILLION COMMON UNITS (4RMC020A)
FULLY CONVERTED N. R. M. WOULD HAVE HUNDRED AND SEVEN MILLION COMMON UNITS WITH MESA OWNING THIRTY THREE MILLION (4RMC020B)
PUBLIC INVESTORS PAID THREE .POINT TWENTY SEVEN DOLLARS FOR EACH N. R. M. COMMON UNIT THEY'RE ENTITLED TO (4RMC020C)
MESA PAID ONE AND A HALF OR TWO AND A HALF DOLLARS DEPENDING ON HOW ONE VIEWS THE TRANSACTION (4RMC020D)
DEATH IS THE KEY WORD SAID ONE INDIVIDUAL FAMILIAR WITH I. C. N. (4RMC020E)
THERE ARE SOME KEY SHARES IN SOME VERY AGED HANDS AND THE FATE OF THIS COMPANY HINGES ON THESE SHARES (4RMC020F)
I DON'T THINK ANYONE COULD BUY THEM TODAY BUT THINGS CHANGE WHEN PEOPLE DIE (4RMC020G)
WASHINGTON POST COMPANY RAISED ITS QUARTERLY DIVIDEND TO THIRTY NINE CENTS A SHARE FROM THIRTY TWO CENTS PAYABLE FEBRUARY TWELVE TO STOCK OF RECORD JANUARY TWENTY NINE (4RMC020H)
A SPOKESMAN FOR THE WASHINGTON PUBLISHING CONCERN SAID THE TWENTY TWO %PERCENT INCREASE REFLECTS EARNINGS GROWTH (4RMC020I)
THE DIVIDEND HAS BEEN RAISED ANNUALLY FOR THE PAST TWELVE YEARS INCLUDING A BOOST OF ABOUT FOURTEEN %PERCENT A YEAR AGO (4RMC020J)
FOR THESE REASONS COOPER CONTINUES TO EXPAND ITS TIRE PLANTS (4RMC020K)
OVER THE PAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS THE COMPANY BOOSTED TIRE CAPACITY BY TWENTY %PERCENT (4RMC020L)
CAPITAL SPENDING THIS YEAR WILL SOAR TO SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FROM FORTY ONE .POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN (4RMC020M)
BOSTON AND SIMILAR MARKETS ARE EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULE THOUGH (4RMC0301)
GENERALLY ECONOMISTS PREDICT THAT HOME PRICES NATIONWIDE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS WILL RISE AT THE MOST ONLY A FEW PERCENTAGE POINTS FASTER THAN INFLATION (4RMC0302)
AND IN SOME DEPRESSED REGIONS HOMES ARE ACTUALLY DEPRECIATING (4RMC0303)
IN WATERLOO IOWA A FARM EQUIPMENT FACTORY TOWN HOME SELLERS ARE COMPETING WITH BANKS STRUGGLING TO UNLOAD HOMES THEY'VE REPOSSESSED (4RMC0304)
PRICES AROUND HERE ARE WHERE THEY WERE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX TO NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT SAYS NANCY ERICKSON A REAL ESTATE AGENT (4RMC0305)
ME AND THE GUY I WAS WITH WERE FISHING ALONG SOME WEEDS NOT GETTING MUCH OF ANYTHING COOK RECALLS (4RMC0306)
I HOOKED A BIG ONE AND IT GOT AWAY (4RMC0307)
I THOUGHT UH OH THAT'S IT FOR ME TODAY (4RMC0308)
COUPLE MINUTES LATER THE EIGHT POUNDER HIT (4RMC0309)
JUST LUCKY I GUESS (4RMC030A)
THE COURT BASED ITS RULING ON A SECTION OF THE LAW STATING THAT PROVISION WHICH COULD RESULT IN THE HIGHEST PRICE SHALL BE APPLICABLE (4RMC030B)
THE PANEL NOTED THAT SINCE MARKET PRICES WERE FAIRLY HIGH WHEN THE LAW WAS PASSED THIS PROVISION SET A CEILING ABOVE WHICH REGULATED PRICES COULDN'T RISE (4RMC030C)
NOW WITH MARKET PRICES LOW IT SERVES AS A PRICE FLOOR BELOW WHICH REGULATED PRICES CAN'T DROP IT SAID (4RMC030D)
THE BOOK HE SAYS WILL BE ABOUT ARVIDA AND GENERALLY ABOUT COMPANIES SNARED IN THE TAKEOVER GAME (4RMC030E)
IT WILL ASK SOME POINTED QUESTIONS IS THERE VALUE ADDED IN CORPORATE MERGERS (4RMC030F)
DOES PRODUCTIVITY INCREASE AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THE PEOPLE INVOLVED (4RMC030G)
THEN THERE ARE UTILITY STOCKS (4RMC030H)
THE NASDAQ UTILITY INDEX JUMPED EIGHTEEN %PERCENT IN THE FIRST QUARTER WHILE INDEXES OF LISTED UTILITY STOCKS ROSE BARELY THREE %PERCENT (4RMC030I)
BUT IN FACT MOST OF THE FIFTY FIVE ELECTRIC GAS AND WATER UTILITY STOCKS ON NASDAQ PERFORMED MUCH LIKE THEIR COUNTERPARTS ON THE MAJOR EXCHANGES (4RMC030J)
BRANIFF CHAIRMAN JAY A. PRITZKER AND HIS FAMILY CONTROL NINETY FOUR %PERCENT OF BRANIFF'S VOTING STOCK (4RMC030K)
BRANIFF'S PROPOSAL TO ACQUIRE PAN AMERICAN WORLD AIRWAYS WOULD GIVE PAN AM CORPORATION COMMON SHAREHOLDERS A FIFTY FIVE %PERCENT INTEREST IN THE MERGED COMPANY (4RMC030L)
BRANIFF SHAREHOLDERS WOULD RECEIVE TWENTY FIVE %PERCENT AND PAN AM'S UNION EMPLOYEES TWENTY %PERCENT IN EXCHANGE FOR WAGE SAVINGS OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FOR FOUR YEARS (4RMC030M)
WHO GOT HER VOTE LAST SEPTEMBER (4RMC030N)
GENERAL (4RMC030O)
BUSSI SHE SAYS (4RMC030P)
I THINK WE NEED A HARD HAND (4RMC030Q)
A MERGER WITH MACY WHICH IS ROUGHLY HALF THE SIZE OF FEDERATED COULD BE ATTRACTIVE TO THE LARGER RETAILER'S EXECUTIVES (4RMC030R)
MACY'S SMALLER SIZE COULD LEAVE FEDERATED'S OFFICERS WITH OPERATING POWER IN A COMBINED CONCERN (4RMC030S)
AND FEELINGS AT FEDERATED HAVE RUN HIGH AGAINST CAMPEAU WHICH SURPRISED THE COMPANY WITH A HOSTILE BID LAST MONTH (4RMC030T)
HOWEVER CAMPEAU'S BID IS ALL CASH AND THE MACY BID ISN'T (4RMC030U)
THE EQUITY PEOPLE AND THE FUTURES PEOPLE HAVE JOINT AND MUTUAL INTERESTS SAID RICHARD L. SANDOR SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AT DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INCORPORATED IN CHICAGO (4RMC030V)
I APPLAUD THE ATTEMPTS AT TRYING TO GET SOME JOINT ACTION (4RMC030W)
IT'S A MILESTONE IN THAT REGARD (4RMC030X)
I JUST WANTED TO TAKE A MINUTE TO THANK YOU FOR RUNNING ALEXANDER COCKBURN'S VIEWPOINT COLUMN (4RMC030Y)
HIS COLUMNS OFTEN PROVIDE A FRESH SLANT ON THE MAJOR ISSUES OF THE DAY (4RMC030Z)
HIS IDEAS ARE OFTEN CONTRARY TO POPULAR OPINION BUT THEY PROVIDE NEW IDEAS TO BROADEN THE READER'S OWN PERSPECTIVE (4RMC0310)
I JUST CHECKED THIS MORNING HE SAID (4RMC0311)
BIDS WERE DOWN A QUARTER TO A HALF A POINT AND I'M TOLD THEY'RE NOW STARTING TO COME BACK (4RMC0312)
IT'S BUSINESS AS USUAL (4RMC0313)
VOLUME IS NO DIFFERENT (4RMC0314)
THE MARKET HASN'T CHANGED CHARACTER (4RMC0315)
SO FAR FROM A MARKET VIEWPOINT IT DOESN'T LOOK TO BE MUCH OF AN EVENT (4RMC0316)
ROSS JOHNSON TYPIFIES A CORPORATE PHENOMENON OF THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES WHAT MIGHT BE CALLED THE NON COMPANY MAN (4RMC0401)
HE HAS LITTLE LOYALTY TO EVEN A VENERABLE ORGANIZATION'S BUSINESSES AND TRADITIONS (4RMC0402)
IN THE NAME OF SHAREHOLDERS HE HAS DRAINED OR SOLD OFF MOTHER BRANDS MOVED INTO NEW LINES LAID OFF LIFELONG EMPLOYEES (4RMC0403)
GAINS FROM ASSET SALES COULD OFFSET THE BANK'S INCREASED LOAN LOSS PROVISIONS IN LATER QUARTERS (4RMC0404)
MELLON'S INTERIM CHIEF EXECUTIVE NATHAN PEARSON TOLD SHAREHOLDERS AT THE BANK'S ANNUAL MEETING MONDAY THAT HE EXPECTS MELLON TO RETURN TO PROFITABILITY THIS YEAR (4RMC0405)
BUT SEVERAL PROFITABLE MELLON BUSINESSES INCLUDING TRUST OPERATIONS AND DATA PROCESSING COULD BE SWAMPED BY CONTINUED LOSSES FROM ENERGY AND REAL ESTATE LOANS (4RMC0406)
TWO DESIRABLE RESULTS ARISE FROM PLACING CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DECISIONS AS CLOSE TO THE SHAREHOLDERS AS POSSIBLE (4RMC0407)
FIRST THE DECISION MAKERS CLOSEST TO THE ISSUE ARE LIKELY TO HAVE THE BEST INFORMATION WITH WHICH TO MAKE DECISIONS (4RMC0408)
SECOND THE OPPORTUNITY ARISES FOR EXPERIMENTATION WITH DIFFERENT RULES OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE (4RMC0409)
CLEVELAND CLIFFS DECLINED TO COMMENT ON MR. BOLGER'S PROPOSAL (4RMC040A)
A SPOKESMAN REFERRING TO MONDAY'S ANNOUNCEMENT SAID FINDING A BUYER FOR THE COMPANY REMAINS ITS FIRST PRIORITY (4RMC040B)
HE SAID A RECAPITALIZATION IS THE COMPANY'S ALTERNATIVE IF A SALE CANNOT BE ACCOMPLISHED (4RMC040C)
MOODY'S SAID BRAZIL HAD DETERIORATED DRASTICALLY POLITICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY OVER THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS (4RMC040D)
IT ALSO SAID ANY DEBT AGREEMENT BETWEEN BRAZIL AND ITS CREDITORS IS LIKELY TO BE DERAILED BY DOMESTIC OPPOSITION (4RMC040E)
VENEZUELA ALSO HAS RECENTLY SPENT MORE FREELY AND IS LIKELY SOON TO MOVE TO MORE POPULIST TOUGHER POSITIONS ON ITS FOREIGN DEBT THE AGENCY SAID (4RMC040F)
RATES ON SHORT TERM TREASURY BILLS ALSO WERE LITTLE CHANGED (4RMC040G)
THE RATE ON THE LATEST THREE MONTH BILL FELL TO FIVE .POINT SEVEN ONE %PERCENT BID FROM FIVE .POINT SEVEN TWO %PERCENT WEDNESDAY (4RMC040H)
BUT THE RATE ON THE LATEST SIX MONTH BILL CLIMBED TO SIX .POINT OH FOUR %PERCENT BID FROM SIX .POINT OH THREE %PERCENT (4RMC040I)
GERMANY'S CHEMICAL INDUSTRY WAS ALWAYS POWERFUL (4RMC040J)
GERMAN DISCOVERIES MORE THAN A CENTURY AGO FORMED THE BASIS FOR MODERN CHEMISTRY AND ITS STOREHOUSE OF KNOW HOW MADE REBUILDING EASIER AFTER WORLD WAR TWO (4RMC040K)
BUT MORE RECENTLY THE BIG THREE USED THEIR FINANCIAL CLOUT AND RESEARCH AND EXPORT STRENGTHS TO BUY AND BUILD A BIGGER PRESENCE IN SPECIFIC MARKET NICHES (4RMC040L)
IT MAY BE TRUE THAT FIFTY MILLION FRENCHMEN CAN'T BE WRONG BUT FIFTY MAJOR FORECASTERS CAN BE (4RMC040M)
WHOSE FAULT IS IT THAT THESE FORECASTERS FAILED TO PREDICT THE STRONG GROWTH RATE IN FIRST QUARTER GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT (4RMC040N)
POOR GOVERNMENT STATISTICS ACCORDING TO THE WALL STREET JOURNAL SHAKY STATISTICS POSE PERIL FOR FORECASTERS THE OUTLOOK MAY NINTH (4RMC040O)
AND WHICH STATISTICAL SERIES MISLED THESE SEERS (4RMC040P)
THE INDEX OF LEADING INDICATORS WE ARE TOLD (4RMC040Q)
PRICES AT THE MASS RETAIL LEVEL HOWEVER HAVEN'T RISEN MUCH IN A DECADE PARTLY BECAUSE BIG RETAILERS USE TENNIS BALLS TO LURE SHOPPERS (4RMC040R)
I REMEMBER PURCHASING A CAN OF BALLS FOR TWO DOLLARS IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN SAYS WALTER L. HENRY A PITTSBURGH RECREATIONAL PLAYER (4RMC040S)
TWO WEEKS AGO I PICKED UP A CAN FOR ONE DOLLAR AND EIGHTY NINE CENTS (4RMC040T)
RICHARD ROSLUND A VICE PRESIDENT OF BLOCK TRADING AT KIDDER PEABODY SAID THE FED CHAIRMAN'S REMARKS GAVE THE MARKET A REASON TO ADOPT A MORE POSITIVE OUTLOOK (4RMC040U)
PEOPLE ARE JUST LOOKING FOR ANYTHING TO GRASP ON HE SAID (4RMC040V)
IT'S BEEN SUCH A PESSIMISTIC ATMOSPHERE IN THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS (4RMC040W)
OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL HAVE BEEN CRACKING DOWN ON ADVERTISING THEY CONSIDER MISLEADING (4RMC040X)
CALIFORNIA AND TEXAS HAVE BEEN ESPECIALLY AGGRESSIVE WITH BOTH FOCUSING ON AIRLINE ADVERTISING AND DEMANDING THAT ADVERTISED AIR FARES INCLUDE ALL CHARGES NOT JUST A BASE PRICE (4RMC040Y)
THE STATES CONTEND THAT LOW ADVERTISED PRICES ARE TOO OFTEN MISLEADING BECAUSE THEY DON'T ADD IN ALL CHARGES (4RMC040Z)
FRANK ROBINSON THE HALL OF FAME HITTER WHO'S THE O'S MANAGER TAKES A LIKE TACK (4RMC0410)
WE'RE NO POWERHOUSE BUT WE'VE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF OUR OPPORTUNITIES SAYS HE (4RMC0411)
IF WE CAN KEEP THAT UP WE'LL BE ALL RIGHT (4RMC0412)
WE'VE BEEN PONDERING THE SIXTEEN COUNT FEDERAL INDICTMENT RETURNED AGAINST CHRYSLER FOR DISCONNECTING ODOMETERS ON NEW CARS THAT ITS EMPLOYEES WERE TEST DRIVING (4RMC0501)
MANY OF THE SOME SIXTY THOUSAND CARS AND TRUCKS WERE DRIVEN FOR UP TO FOUR HUNDRED MILES (4RMC0502)
LEE IACOCCA HAS NOW CALLED THIS PRACTICE DUMB AND STUPID (4RMC0503)
AROUND THAT TIME MR. GENGER ALSO MET WITH MR. EL SAYED (4RMC0504)
HE SURFACED TO MEET WITH GENGER AFTER GENGER HAD MADE THE APPROACH TO THE COMPANY SAID MR. TROTMAN THE DREXEL BURNHAM BANKER (4RMC0505)
I THINK HE WAS TRYING TO FIND A WAY BACK IN (4RMC0506)
BUT MR. TROTMAN SAID MR. EL SAYED ISN'T INVOLVED IN THE TRANS RESOURCES BID (4RMC0507)
I FIRST ENCOUNTERED PRESS BIAS ON PORNOGRAPHY WHEN I WAS COVERING THE COMMISSION'S MEETINGS (4RMC0508)
THE ONLY OTHER REPORTERS AT ALL THREE HEARINGS I ATTENDED WORKED FOR PORNOGRAPHIC MAGAZINES SUCH AS PENTHOUSE AND PLAYBOY (4RMC0509)
THE NETWORKS COVERED ONLY ONE MORNING IN THREE WEEKS OF HEARINGS (4RMC050A)
HE ALSO QUESTIONED WHETHER OPEC PRODUCTION IS AS HIGH AS IT IS THOUGHT BY MANY TO BE (4RMC050B)
THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF SPECULATION AS TO WHAT THE ACTUAL LEVEL IS HE SAID (4RMC050C)
BUT HE ADDED I HOPE THAT THIS OVERPRODUCTION IS AN ABERRATION AND NOT A TREND (4RMC050D)
G. E. SAYS THAT ON THE CONTRARY THE WEAKNESS IN SOME MARKETS PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR EVEN GREATER GROWTH AS SOME FINANCING COMPETITORS PULL BACK (4RMC050E)
DENNIS CAREY GENERAL MANAGER OF CORPORATE FINANCIAL SERVICES AT G. E. CREDIT SAYS THE MAJORITY OF OUR DEALS ARE BASED ON FUTURE CASH FLOWS (4RMC050F)
AND WE BELIEVE THE CASH FLOWS WILL BE THERE (4RMC050G)
THE CHANGE ALLOWS LAW FIRMS TO TOUT THEMSELVES AS FULL SERVICE PRACTICES (4RMC050H)
THAT COMPLEMENTS CORPORATE PRACTICE SAYS MORRISON COHEN AND SINGER NOTING EXECUTIVES OFTEN WANT LAWYERS INTIMATE WITH THEIR FINANCIAL AFFAIRS TO HANDLE THEIR DIVORCES (4RMC050I)
A BIG UPSURGE IN DIVORCES IS EXPECTED AMONG STOCKBROKERS INVESTMENT BANKERS AND TRADERS IN THE WAKE OF THE OCTOBER NINETEENTH CRASH ON WALL STREET (4RMC050J)
THEN A THIRTY SECOND SPOT COMES ALONG THAT WE SPENT TWELVE WEEKS ON (4RMC050K)
WITHIN TWO WEEKS WE COULD TELL IT WAS TAKING OFF (4RMC050L)
THERE WAS A HUGE RESPONSE (4RMC050M)
BUT IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME SAYS MR. VINTON WITH JUST A TRACE OF SOUR GRAPES (4RMC050N)
BUT THERE IS ALWAYS THE RISK THAT REVIVING A CLASSIC SLOGAN OR SPOKESMAN WILL BACKFIRE AND CREATE AN OLD FASHIONED IMAGE FOR A BRAND (4RMC050O)
TO GUARD AGAINST THAT MARKETERS TEND TO GIVE THEIR RECYCLED ADS A CONTEMPORARY TWIST (4RMC050P)
THE CAPTAIN RAID OF NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT FOR EXAMPLE HAS RIPPLING MUSCLES AND A FUTURISTIC LOOK (4RMC050Q)
AND A WOMAN IN ONE OF THE NEW NESTEA SPOTS DOESN'T JUST TUMBLE INTO A SWIMMING POOL SHE FALLS ONTO AN EXERCISE MAT THAT TURNS INTO A POOL (4RMC050R)
IN THE COMMITTEE HEARING MR. SEIDMAN HAD BEEN ASKED WHETHER ANY OTHER U. S. BANKS ARE EXPECTED TO FAIL IN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS (4RMC050S)
WE DO NOT SEE ANY MAJOR BANKS BEYOND MAYBE ONE OR PERHAPS TWO THAT WE MIGHT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HE SAID (4RMC050T)
HE ADDED THAT HE COULDN'T IDENTIFY ANY MAJOR FAILURE CANDIDATES FOR SURE (4RMC050U)
RUBLES ARE LITTLE BILLS THE SIZE OF MONOPOLY MONEY (4RMC050V)
THE THREES ARE GREEN FIVE BLUE TENS BUFF TWENTY FIVES RUST FIFTIES GREEN AGAIN (4RMC050W)
LIKE MONOPOLY MONEY THEY TEND TO PILE UP SO THAT THE UNWARY TRAVELER MAY END A STAY WITH MORE THAN HE BEGAN AN ECONOMIC CRIME (4RMC050X)
A SIMPLER WAY TO REDUCE BANK DEBTS THAT IS MORE ADVANTAGEOUS TO BORROWERS ARE STRAIGHT BUYBACKS IN THE GROWING SECONDARY LOAN MARKET (4RMC050Y)
BUYBACKS HELPED CLEAR UP LATIN AMERICAN DEBT PROBLEMS IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES (4RMC050Z)
IN MARCH BOLIVIA BOUGHT BACK JUST UNDER HALF ITS SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION DOLLAR BANK DEBT AT ELEVEN CENTS FOR EACH DOLLAR OF DEBT (4RMC0510)
THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT AFTER A DAY SPENT IDLING ON AN L. A. FREEWAY IT'S POSSIBLE TO FEEL THE EFFECTS OF OZONE (4RMC0511)
BUT WHAT EXACTLY IS ITS THREAT TO LIFE OR HEALTH (4RMC0512)
THE BULK OF THE MEDICAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THE EFFECTS OF OZONE WHEEZING COUGHING AND TIGHTENING IN THE CHEST ARE SHORT TERM AND REVERSIBLE (4RMC0513)
THESE EFFECTS BEGIN AT OZONE LEVELS TWO OR THREE TIMES THE FEDERAL STANDARD THOUGH A FEW STUDIES DETECTED SLIGHT EFFECTS AT JUST ABOVE THE STANDARD (4RMC0514)
PEOPLE DOING HEAVY EXERCISE WHEN OZONE IS TWO OR THREE TIMES THE STANDARD MAY EXPERIENCE A TEMPORARY LOSS OF LUNG CAPACITY FROM SEVEN %PERCENT TO FIFTEEN %PERCENT (4RMC0515)
VARIATIONS BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD (4RMC0516)
THAT DECISION CAME EASILY (4RMC0601)
NOW HE'S WORKING AMID THE METAL FOLDING CHAIRS IN HIS TRANSITION OFFICE IN THE AUSTERE CHAMBER OF THE SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE (4RMC0602)
HIS FIRST BUDGET MUST GO TO THE PRINTER TWO DAYS AFTER HE'S INAUGURATED (4RMC0603)
THE LEFT SAYS IT WILL STOP ITS DESTRUCTION WHEN PRESIDENT DUARTE BRINGS THE REBELS INTO THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMY IN AN OFFICIAL POWER SHARING ARRANGEMENT (4RMC0604)
THAT WON'T HAPPEN SOON IF EVER (4RMC0605)
BUT IN CONTESTED ZONES THE GUERRILLAS ARE ALREADY INVOLVED IN A DE FACTO POWER SHARING RELATIONSHIP WITH SAN SALVADOR (4RMC0606)
SMOKERS ARE FEELING THE HEAT BECAUSE COMPANIES ARE TAKING A HARDER LINE ON SUCH ISSUES AS PRODUCTIVITY RISING MEDICAL COSTS AND THE EFFECTS OF PASSIVE SMOKE (4RMC0607)
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE CONFLICTING CLAIMS ABOUT WHETHER SMOKERS COST EMPLOYERS MORE IN TERMS OF HIGHER INSURANCE RATES AND ABSENTEEISM COMPANIES OFTEN CITE SUCH CONCERNS TO JUSTIFY RESTRICTIVE SMOKING POLICIES (4RMC0608)
IN ADDITION NEW STATE AND LOCAL ORDINANCES AND EMPLOYEE COMPLAINTS PUT SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE ON MANY COMPANIES (4RMC0609)
THE MOVIE IS DRAWN FROM THE NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF GABY BRIMMER THEN THE THIRTY FOUR YEAR OLD DAUGHTER OF JEWISH REFUGEES IN MEXICO CITY (4RMC060A)
SHE WAS RAISED BY LOVING PARENTS IN UPPER MIDDLE CLASS COMFORT BUT SHE WAS CRIPPLED FROM BIRTH (4RMC060B)
MS. BRIMMER GREW UP ABLE TO MOVE ONLY HER LEFT FOOT (4RMC060C)
SHE COULDN'T TALK OR WALK OR WIPE HER FOREHEAD (4RMC060D)
NOTHING BESIDES THAT MOBILE FOOT WORKED EXCEPT HER BRAIN WHICH WORKED OVERTIME (4RMC060E)
RATHER THAT WASN'T A QUESTION (4RMC060F)
IT WAS A STATEMENT (4RMC060G)
MAY I ASK A QUESTION ABOUT (4RMC060H)
CRASHES OBVIOUSLY ARE BIG NEWS AND RIGHTLY SO (4RMC060I)
IN THE PAST DECADE U. S. AIR TRAVEL HAS NEARLY DOUBLED TO MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION PASSENGERS A YEAR (4RMC060J)
THE PUBLIC IS INTERESTED IN COMMERCIAL AVIATION PARTICULARLY SAFETY QUESTIONS (4RMC060K)
AT FIRST THE REBELS TRIED TO STRUGGLE ALONG WITH THEIR HOMEGROWN MULES (4RMC060L)
BUT THESE ANIMALS WERE A SCRAWNY LOT BY AMERICAN STANDARDS AND WHEN THEY WEREN'T WORKED TO DEATH THEY WERE GUNNED DOWN BY THE SOVIETS (4RMC060M)
THE TURKS WERE NEARBY BUT THEY ALSO HAD INFERIOR MULES (4RMC060N)
THE CHINESE CHARGED OUTLANDISH RATES FULLY TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MULE (4RMC060O)
THE EGYPTIANS WERE QUICKLY DRAINED OF THEIR SUPPLY (4RMC060P)
THE U. S. WAS THE REBELS' LAST BEST HOPE (4RMC060Q)
THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER PROVISIONS IN THE TRADE BILL THAT AMERICA'S PARTNERS FIND NO LESS DISCONCERTING (4RMC060R)
COMPANIES THAT VIOLATE EXPORT CONTROLS FOR INSTANCE COULD BE BARRED FROM THE U. S. MARKET AND GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS FOR FIVE YEARS (4RMC060S)
ALSO PROBLEMATIC IN MY VIEW IS THAT THE U. S. WOULD CALL FOREIGN COMPANIES TO ACCOUNT FOR VIOLATIONS OF FOREIGN LAW COMMITTED ABROAD (4RMC060T)
RESTRICTING THE PRESIDENT'S SCOPE FOR ACTION REGARDING IMPORTS ALSO COULD TEND TO HARDEN INTERNATIONAL FRONTS (4RMC060U)
STEPHEN A. DUZAN CHAIRMAN PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER SAID IT'S OBVIOUSLY QUITE A CHANGE FROM A YEAR AGO (4RMC060V)
IT'S OUR THIRD YEAR OF CASH FLOW AND WE'VE BEEN PROFITABLE FOR THREE OUT OF THE LAST FOUR QUARTERS (4RMC060W)
SO WE THINK IN GENERAL THAT THIS REPRESENTS A REAL HEALTHY KIND OF PICTURE FOR A COMPANY WHOSE PRODUCTS AREN'T YET APPROVED (4RMC060X)
THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS FOUR OF ITS EXPERIMENTAL PRODUCTS IN HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS FOR DISEASES SUCH AS CANCER AND ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME (4RMC060Y)
AS BRITAIN'S FLAG CARRIER THE AIRLINE INHERITED A VAST ROUTE NETWORK (4RMC060Z)
BRITISH CALEDONIAN BROUGHT ROUTES TO THE SOUTHERN U. S. THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA AS WELL AS LUCRATIVE FLIGHTS TO EAST ASIA (4RMC0610)
BRITISH AIRWAYS GAVE UP ONLY A FEW ROUTES FROM GATWICK TO EUROPEAN CITIES WHICH IN MOST CASE IT ALREADY SERVED FROM HEATHROW (4RMC0611)
BUT OTHER EVIDENCE ON THE FLAPS IS CONFLICTING (4RMC0612)
ONE OF THE CREW MEMBERS CAN BE HEARD ON THE COCKPIT VOICE RECORDER CALLING OUT FLAPS FIFTEEN FIFTEEN THE CORRECT POSITION FOR THE FLAPS (4RMC0613)
AND THE RECORDER INDICATES THAT A COCKPIT ALARM THAT SHOULD HAVE ALERTED THE CREW TO IMPROPERLY SET FLAPS DIDN'T GO OFF (4RMC0614)
AS HOLDERS OF THE CLASS B. STOCK THE MORRIS FAMILY ELECTS FOUR OF THE NINE DIRECTORS OF STEWART (4RNC0201)
ANY TAKEOVER BID REQUIRES A TWO THIRDS VOTE OF THE BOARD TO BE CONSIDERED (4RNC0202)
THE OWNERS OF THE CLASS B. HAVE PREVIOUSLY AGREED TO RESTRICTIONS ON THE SALE OF THEIR STOCK TO NON FAMILY MEMBERS UNTIL THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND FIVE (4RNC0203)
THE RULING CAME IN A TRIAL BILLED AS THE NATION'S LARGEST EVER IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS (4RNC0204)

AT FORTY EIGHT CENTS TO FIFTY TWO CENTS MEXICAN DEBT IS OFF ABOUT FIFTEEN %PERCENT (4RNC020C)
BASSETT SAID THE PLAN WASN'T ADOPTED IN RESPONSE TO ANY SPECIFIC ATTEMPT TO ACQUIRE CONTROL OF IT (4RNC020D)
THE PLAN WILL GIVE SHAREHOLDERS ONE RIGHT FOR EACH SHARE HELD ON MAY SEVENTEENTH (4RNC020E)
THE RIGHTS WILL EXPIRE MAY SIXTEENTH NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT (4RNC020F)
FEE REQUESTS AFTER THE BANKRUPTCY LAW FILING AMOUNTED TO FOUR .POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR FIVE THOUSAND THIRTY ONE HOURS OF WORK (4RNC020G)
THE ATTORNEYS WERE GRANTED TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS AS WELL AS HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED THIRTY DOLLARS FOR EXPENSES (4RNC020H)
HOWEVER ONLY EIGHT OF THE NINETEEN FIRMS WERE GRANTED FEE PAYMENTS FOR WORK DONE AFTER THE BANKRUPTCY LAW FILING (4RNC020I)
YET WHEN WE DISCUSS SOCIAL POLICY WE TALK AS IF MONEY THE POVERTY RATE WAS ALL THAT MATTERS (4RNC020J)
IT IS THE GENERIC STAND IN FOR THE SOCIAL PROBLEMS OF OUR AGE MR. MURRAY WRITES (4RNC020K)
SOLVE THE RIDDLE OF POVERTY WE HAVE OFTEN SEEMED TO HOPE AND THE REST OF OUR PROBLEMS WILL SOLVE THEMSELVES (4RNC020L)
IN AN INTERVIEW HOWEVER MR. TAFT SAID HE SIMPLY WANTS TO RETURN THE COMPANY TO FAMILY CONTROL (4RNC0301)
HIS FATHER FOUNDED THE CONCERN IN NINETEEN THIRTY NINE (4RNC0302)
THERE HAVE BEEN RUMORS FOR SOME TIME THAT MR. TAFT WAS UNHAPPY WITH THE CHANGES TAKING PLACE AT THE COMPANY AND WAS PREPARING TO RESIGN (4RNC0303)
MR. REINHARD REMEMBERS AN INDIAN COMMERCIAL TWO YEARS AGO AT THE PRESTIGIOUS CANNES FESTIVAL NO RELATION TO THE FILM FESTIVAL THERE (4RNC0304)
IT SHOWED A CLOSE UP OF A FLATULENT ELEPHANT'S BACKSIDE WHILE AN ANNOUNCER EXPLAINED THE SOUND IN PLAIN LANGUAGE (4RNC0305)
THE COMMERCIAL PLUGGED AN ANTACID FOR HUMANS (4RNC0306)
IT DIDN'T WIN (4RNC0307)
MOREOVER A WESTERN FIRM HAS TO MAKE SOME CALCULATION OF WHETHER MR. GORBACHEV WILL SUCCEED IN HIS EFFORTS TO ACTIVATE THE SOVIET WORK FORCE (4RNC0308)

AMONG THOSE CONTACTED THIS WEEK BY THE GOVERNMENT WERE REPRESENTATIVES FOR RECORDING ARTISTS STING AND R. E. M. SOURCES SAID (50EC0108)
LAWYERS FOR PEARL JAM HAVE ACCUSED TICKETMASTER OF EXERCISING A MONOPOLY OVER TICKET DISTRIBUTION AND USING THAT INFLUENCE TO KEEP PROMOTERS FROM BOOKING THE BAND'S SUMMER TOUR WHICH WAS CANCELED (50EC0109)
PEARL JAM SOUGHT TO LIMIT TICKET PRICES TO EIGHTEEN DOLLARS PLUS A DOLLAR EIGHTY HANDLING FEE LOW BY POP STANDARDS (50EC010A)
THE BAND'S COMPLAINT FILED BY SULLIVAN AND CROMWELL A PROMINENT NEW YORK LAW FIRM ALLEGED THAT TICKETMASTER HAS EXCLUSIVE ARRANGEMENTS WITH ALL IMPORTANT CONCERT VENUES IN THE COUNTRY AND USES THE RELATIONSHIPS TO CEMENT CONTROL OVER THE DISTRIBUTION OF TICKETS TO CONCERTS (50EC010B)
TICKETMASTER HAS DOMINATED THE TICKET MARKET SINCE NINETEEN NINETY ONE (50EC010C)
IN MAY OF THAT YEAR THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S ANTITRUST DIVISION GAVE THE GO AHEAD FOR TICKETMASTER TO BUY CERTAIN ASSETS FROM TICKETRON WHICH AT THE TIME WAS ITS ONLY MAJOR COMPETITOR (50EC010D)
NEW YORK A NEW STUDY STRONGLY SUGGESTS THAT THE UNITED STATES' BROKERAGE FIRMS COLLUDE WITH ONE ANOTHER TO RIG OVER THE COUNTER TRADING AND ENSURE THEMSELVES ARTIFICIALLY HIGH TRADING PROFITS AT THE EXPENSE OF INVESTORS (50EC010E)
THE STUDY BY TWO BUSINESS PROFESSORS EXAMINED PRICE DATA FOR THE STOCKS OF ONE HUNDRED LARGE COMPANIES TRADED ON THE N. A. S. D. A. Q. MARKET FOR OVER THE COUNTER STOCKS AND IS BELIEVED TO BE THE FIRST TO EXAMINE SUCH PRICE DATA IN GREAT DETAIL (50EC010F)
IT CAME UP WITH THE SEEMINGLY BIZARRE FINDING THAT FOR TWENTY SEVENTY ONE OF THESE STOCKS INCLUDING SUCH GIANT COMPANIES AS APPLE COMPUTER AND LOTUS DEVELOPMENT PRICES WERE ALMOST NEVER POSTED ON N. A. S. D. A. Q. IN ODD EIGHTHS SUCH AS TWENTY TWO AND ONE EIGHTH TWENTY TWO AND THREE EIGHTHS TWENTY TWO AND FIVE EIGHTHS AND TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY TWO AND SEVEN EIGHTHS (50EC010G)
NEW YORK A NEW STUDY STRONGLY SUGGESTS THAT THE UNITED STATES' BROKERAGE FIRMS COLLUDE WITH ONE ANOTHER TO RIG OVER THE COUNTER TRADING AND ENSURE THEMSELVES ARTIFICIALLY HIGH TRADING PROFITS AT THE EXPENSE OF INVESTORS (50FC0101)
THE STUDY BY TWO BUSINESS PROFESSORS EXAMINED PRICE DATA FOR THE STOCKS OF A HUNDRED LARGE COMPANIES TRADED ON THE NASDAQ MARKET FOR OVER THE COUNTER STOCKS IS BELIEVED TO BE THE FIRST TO EXAMINE SUCH PRICE DATA IN IN GREAT DETAIL (50FC0102)
IT CAME UP WITH THE SEEMINGLY BIZARRE FINDING THAT FOR SEVENTY ONE OF THESE STOCKS INCLUDING SUCH GREAT GIANT COMPANIES AS APPLE COMPUTER AND LOTUS DEVELOPMENT PRICES WERE ALMOST NEVER POSTED ON THE NASDAQ IN ODD EIGHTHS SUCH AS TWENTY TWO AND ONE EIGHTH TWENTY TWO AND THREE EIGHTHS TWENTY TWO FIVE EIGHTHS AND TWENTY TWO SEVEN EIGHTHS (50FC0103)
AS A RESULT THE SPREAD BETWEEN BID AND ASKED PRICES IN EFFECT THE PROFIT THE BROKERAGE BROKERAGE FIRM MAKES ON EACH SHARE TRADED WAS ALMOST NEVER LESS THAN A QUARTER OF A POINT OR TWENTY FIVE CENTS PER SHARE (50FC0104)
THE STUDY MOST OF WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY CONDEMNED BY THE NASDAQ COMES AS AS CRITICISM OF THE FAIRNESS OF OVER THE COUNTER TRADING HAS ESCALATED IN RECENT MONTHS (50FC0105)
IT ALSO COMES AT A TIME OF FIERCE RIVALRY BETWEEN THE HIGHLY COMPUTERIZED NASDAQ SYSTEM AND EXCHANGES SUCH AS THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE AND THE AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE (50FC0106)
NASDAQ HAS USED FAIRNESS AND EFFICIENCY AS A KEY POINT OF ITS MARKETING (50FC0107)
THE AUTHORS OF THE STUDY VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY BUSINESS PROFESSOR WILLIAM CHRISTIE AND OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY BUSINESS PROFESSOR PAUL SCHULTZ MADE COPIES OF THEIR STUDY AVAILABLE WEDNESDAY (50FC0108)
CHRISTIE SAID IT WAS ACCEPTED FOR PUBLICATION IN THE NEXT ISSUE OF THE JOURNAL OF FINANCE DUE OUT IN ABOUT SIX MONTHS (50FC0109)
THE JOURNAL IS THE OFFICIAL PUBLICATION OF THE AMERICAN FINANCE ASSOCIATION AN ORGANIZATION OF PROFESSORS WHO SPECIALIZE IN ECONOMICS BUSINESS AND FINANCE (50FC010A)
THE STUDY INITIALLY EXAMINED DATA FOR THE FULL YEAR NINETEEN NINETY ONE AND THEN WENT BACK AND CONFIRMED THE SAME RESULTS FOR NINETEEN NINETY FOUR TO DATE ACCORDING TO CHRISTIE (50FC010B)
RICHARD G. KETCHUM CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SECURITIES DEALERS WHICH OPERATES NASDAQ IN AN INTERVIEW DID NOT DISPUTE THAT THE SEVENTY ONE STOCKS ALMOST NEVER TRADE AT SPREADS NARROWER THAN TWENTY FIVE CENTS (50FC010C)
BUT HE SAID THERE WERE LEGITIMATE REASONS (50FC010D)
HE SAID THE STUDY IS IRRESPONSIBLE AND IN FACT WE BELIEVE IT TO BE SLANDEROUS (50FC010E)
THE AUTHORS EMPHASIZED THAT THEY HAVE NO CONCLUSIVE PROOF OF COLLUSION WHICH WOULD VIOLATE SECURITIES LAWS (50FC010F)
BUT AFTER ANALYZING AND REJECTING OTHER POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS THEY STATED WE ARE UNABLE TO OFFER ANY OTHER PLAUSIBLE EXPLANATION FOR THE LACK OF ODD EIGHTH QUOTES (50FC010G)
HOLIDAY DRIVERS WHO PULLED INTO SERVICE STATIONS ACROSS THE NATION LAST WEEKEND WERE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S GREAT BARGAINS GASOLINE HAS NEVER BEEN CHEAPER THAN IT HAS BEEN THIS YEAR COMPARED WITH WHAT PEOPLE PAY FOR OTHER GOODS AND SERVICES (50GC0101)
ENCOURAGED BY THE LOW COST OF FUEL AMERICANS HAVE BEEN BUYING MORE AND MORE CARS AND LIGHT TRUCKS A CATEGORY THAT INCLUDES MOST MINIVANS AND DRIVING THEM FARTHER (50GC0102)
FOR INSTANCE THE AMERICAN AUTOMOBILE ASSOCIATION ESTIMATED BEFORE THE HOLIDAY THAT TWENTY FIVE MILLION PEOPLE USED A CAR LIGHT TRUCK OR RECREATIONAL VEHICLE TO DRIVE MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED MILES FROM HOME THIS WEEKEND WHILE ANOTHER THREE .POINT FIVE MILLION TRAVELED THAT DISTANCE BY AIRPLANE TRAIN OR BUS (50GC0103)
THE MAJOR REASONS FOR THE RECORD NUMBER OF HOLIDAY TRAVELERS INCLUDE AN IMPROVED ECONOMY LOW GASOLINE PRICES STABLE LODGING AND MEAL COSTS AND AIRFARE DISCOUNTS SAID TRIPLE A. POTOMAC (50GC0104)
THE LOW COST OF THE KEROSENE TYPE JET FUEL MOST COMMERCIAL AIRLINERS USE IS ONE REASON SO MANY AIRLINES ARE OFFERING DISCOUNT FARES (50GC0105)
ACTUAL JET FUEL FUEL PRICES THIS YEAR ARE ABOUT HALF WHAT THEY WERE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE AND COMPARED WITH PRICES OF OTHER INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS THEY'RE DOWN MORE THAN THAT (50GC0106)
HOWEVER IT IS NOT JUST TRAVEL THAT IS AFFECTED BY LOW FUEL PRICES (50GC0107)
EXPERTS SAY ONE REASON THAT SALES HAVE BEEN BOOMING FOR PICKUP TRUCKS MINIVANS AND FOUR WHEEL DRIVE VEHICLES WHICH GENERALLY ARE LESS FUEL EFFICIENT THAN MOST CARS IS THAT FUEL COST IS NOT A DETERRENT (50GC0108)
MEANWHILE LOW FUEL COSTS ARE HAVING A MAJOR IMPACT ON AIR POLLUTION PARTICULARLY IN URBAN AREAS ACCORDING TO A NUMBER OF ANALYSTS (50GC0109)
THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT IS SIMPLY THAT PEOPLE ARE DRIVING MORE MILES (50GC010A)
SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED HAVE INCREASED BY SIXTY NINE %PERCENT PARTIALLY OFFSETTING REDUCTIONS IN EMISSIONS PER MILE BROUGHT ABOUT BY NEW CAR EMISSIONS STANDARDS RECENTLY WROTE WINSTON HARRINGTON AND MARGARET A. WALLS ANALYSTS AT RESOURCES FOR THE FUTURE A WASHINGTON ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH ORGANIZATION (50GC010B)
HARRINGTON AND WALLS ALSO NOTE THAT THE AVERAGE AGE OF THE U. S. FLEET OF VEHICLES HAS GONE UP SUBSTANTIALLY COMPOUNDING THE PROBLEM (50GC010C)
EMISSION CONTROL SYSTEMS TEND TO BREAK DOWN AS CARS GET OLDER CAUSING EMISSIONS TO RISE THEY SAY (50GC010D)
WHILE IT MAY BE THAT THE NEWER GENERATION OF CARS AND LIGHT TRUCKS ARE MORE DURABLE THAN THEIR PREDECESSORS LOW FUEL COSTS ALSO HAVE ENCOURAGED MANY OWNERS OF OLDER LESS FUEL EFFICIENT VEHICLES TO KEEP THEM ON THE ROAD LONGER (50GC010E)
SOME ANALYSTS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT A COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO REDUCE EMISSIONS IS TO HAVE A PUBLIC AGENCY BUY AND SCRAP SUCH CARS TO UPGRADE THE AVERAGE LEVEL OF EMISSIONS CONTROL EFFECTIVENESS (50GC010F)
SEVERAL OTHER POLLUTION CONTROL STRATEGIES COULD DIRECTLY AFFECT THE PRICE OF GASOLINE AT LEAST INITIALLY (50GC010G)
TWO MAJOR STEEL PRODUCERS REPORTED FIRST QUARTER PROFITS AS A RESULT OF RISING SALES AND HIGHER PRICES (50HC0101)
INLAND STEEL INDUSTRIES INCORPORATED EARNED NINE .POINT TWO MILLION OR THREE CENTS A SHARE COMPARED WITH A NET LOSS OF THIRTY ONE DOLLARS .POINT FOUR MILLION OR ONE DOLLAR AND TWELVE CENTS A SHARE A YEAR EARLIER (50HC0102)
THE COMPANY'S MAJOR STEELMAKING UNIT INLAND STEEL SHIPMENTS ROSE THREE .POINT SEVEN %PERCENT TO ONE MILLION TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE THOUSAND TONS WHILE PRICES JUMPED NINE .POINT EIGHT %PERCENT FROM A YEAR AGO (50HC0103)
THE CHICAGO BASED COMPANY SAID THE IMPROVEMENTS IN ITS STEEL OPERATIONS WERE PARTIALLY SET OFF BY A SIXTEEN MILLION IN UNEXPECTED OPERATING COSTS ARISING FROM SEVERE WINTER WEATHER AND UNDERPERFORMANCE BY THE COMPANY'S PLATE OPERATIONS (50HC0104)
SINCE IMPLEMENTING A STIFF COST REDUCTION PLAN INLAND STEEL HAS REDUCED ITS WORK FORCE BY MORE THAN TWENTY SIX HUNDRED (50HC0105)
THE COMPANY SAID IT PLANS A FURTHER CUT OF NINE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES TO ACHIEVE ITS COST TARGETS FOR THE YEAR (50HC0106)
WHEELING PITTSBURGH CORPORATION SAID IT EARNED TWENTY SIX .POINT FIVE MILLION OR EIGHTY THREE CENTS A SHARE IN THE FIRST QUARTER COMPARED WITH A LOSS OF TWO .POINT EIGHT MILLION OR FIFTEEN CENTS A SHARE IN THE NINETEEN NINETY THREE FIRST QUARTER (50HC0107)
THE LATEST PERIOD INCLUDES A TEN MILLION DOLLAR CHARGE FOR ACCOUNTING CHANGES AFTER AN AN AFTER TAX GAIN OF TWENTY SIX .POINT SEVEN MILLION RESULTING FROM A PREVIOUSLY REPORTED LEGAL SETTLEMENT (50HC0108)
EXCLUDING THESE ITEMS IT EARNED NINE .POINT EIGHT MILLION OR TWENTY FIVE CENTS A SHARE (50HC0109)
WHEELING PITTSBURGH IS WHICH IS BASED IN WHEELING WEST VIRGINIA SAID REVENUE WAS AIDED BY HIGHER PRICES AS WELL AS BY THE COMPANY'S HIGHER VALUE ADDED PRODUCT MIX (50HC010A)
THIS WAS OFFSET SOMEWHAT BY A THIRTY EXCUSE ME THREE .POINT SIX %PERCENT DROP IN SHIPMENTS WHICH TOTALED THREE FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND TONS FOR THE QUARTER (50HC010B)
THE COMPANY BLAMED THE BAD WEATHER AND A TWO DAY STRIKE FOR THE REDUCED SHIPMENTS (50HC010C)
IN THE NEW YORK STATE STOCK EXCHANGE COMPOSITE TRADING INLAND CLOSED AT THIRTY THREE DOLLARS AND TWELVE AND A HALF CENTS DOWN AND A DOLLAR TWELVE AND A HALF CENTS WHILE WHEELING PITTSBURGH FINISHED THE DAY AT SIXTEEN DOLLARS AND TWELVE AND A HALF CENTS DOWN AND TWELVE AND A HALF CENTS (50HC010D)

AT LUNCH IN BEVERLY HILLS CALIFORNIA THEY SAY YOU NEVER YOU CAN NEVER BE TOO RICH OR TOO THIN (50IC0101)
IN THE CORPORATE DINING ROOMS OF THE NATION'S BANKS THE REFRAIN HAS BEEN YOU CAN NEVER HAVE TOO MUCH CAPITAL (50IC0102)
NOW WHILE FAT WAISTLINES MAY NOT BE IN FASHION FAT BALANCE SHEETS ARE BECOMING PASSE (50IC0103)
IT'S NOT THAT BANKS WANT THEIR BALANCE SHEETS TO RETURN TO THE SCRAWNY WAIF LIKE STATE OF THE LATE NINETEEN EIGHTIES WHEN CAPITAL WAS SEVERELY DEPLETED BY WAVES OF BAD LOANS TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND REAL ESTATE VENTURES (50IC0104)
BUT BANKS NOW HAVE MORE MONEY THAN THEY KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH SO THEY ARE GIVING SOME BACK TO SHAREHOLDERS BY SHARPLY INCREASING DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASING THEIR OWN STOCK (50IC0105)
FRIDAY FOR EXAMPLE CHEMICAL BANKING CORP. SAID IT WOULD BUY BACK UP TO TEN MILLION SHARES ALMOST FOUR %PERCENT OF THOSE OUTSTANDING IN THE NEXT YEAR (50IC0106)
AT THE CURRENT PRICE THAT WOULD MEAN SPENDING AS MUCH AS FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS (50IC0107)
CHEMICAL WILL ALSO REDEEM THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS OF PREFERRED STOCK ISSUING ONLY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION IN NEW PREFERRED STOCK AT A LOWER RATE (50IC0108)
OTHER COMPANIES INCLUDING J. P. MORGAN AND CO. FIRST CHICAGO AND BANK OF NEW YORK ARE ALSO BUYING BACK THEIR SHARES (50IC0109)
BANK CAPITAL IS THE MONEY SUPPLIED BY INVESTORS AND FROM EARNINGS NOT PAID OUT AS DIVIDENDS (50IC010A)
SINCE THE LATE NINETEEN EIGHTIES REGULATORS HAVE REQUIRED BANKS TO BUILD RESERVES BECAUSE THE MORE CAPITAL A BANK HAS THE MORE LOSSES IT CAN ABSORB BEFORE IT FAILS (50IC010B)
BANK CAPITAL WAS DRAINED IN NINETEEN NINETY BECAUSE OF BAD REAL ESTATE LOANS (50IC010C)
SINCE THEN BANKS HAVE RAISED NEW CAPITAL BY STOCK SALES (50IC010D)
AND AS INTEREST RATES FELL AND LOAN LOSSES RECEDED BANK EARNINGS SOARED LIFTING CAPITAL TO THE HIGHEST LEVELS IN DECADES (50IC010E)
INVESTORS OF COURSE DON'T WANT BANKS TO BE UNDERCAPITALIZED BECAUSE IT INCREASES THE RISK OF FAILURE (50IC010F)
ON THE OTHER HAND HAVING TOO MUCH CAPITAL DILUTES EARNINGS (50IC010G)
BEIJING SECURITIES WATCHDOGS ARE CRACKING DOWN ON THE NEWEST FAD TO HIT CHINA'S FLEDGLING FINANCIAL SYSTEM TRADING OF NONEXISTENT TREASURY BONDS (50JC0101)
THE CHINA SECURITIES REGULATORY COMMISSION MINISTRY OF FINANCE AND CENTRAL PEOPLE'S BANK ISSUED A DECREE DEMANDING A RESOLUTE STOP TO WHAT THE OFFICIAL CHINA DAILY DESCRIBED ON SUNDAY AS THE SHORT SELLING OF TREASURY BONDS (50JC0102)
THE ACTION WAS TAKEN BECAUSE SOME SECURITIES INTERMEDIARIES ARE SELLING MORE TREASURY BONDS THAN THEY ACTUALLY OWN BY ISSUING CUSTODY CERTIFICATES TO BUYERS THE NEWSPAPER SAID (50JC0103)
THE PRACTICE APPARENTLY AN UNEXPECTED SIDE EFFECT OF CHINA'S EXPERIMENT WITH PAPERLESS SCRIP IN EFFECT EXPANDS THE AMOUNT OF GOVERNMENT BONDS THUS ENDANGERING BEIJING'S MACRO ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS' INTERESTS IT SAID (50JC0104)
THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT EDICT SAID ALL GOVERNMENT DEBT TRADED OVER THE COUNTER AS OF JULY FIRST MUST REPRESENT ACTUAL BONDS AND NOT CUSTODY CERTIFICATES (50JC0105)
INSTITUTIONS TRADING BONDS THROUGH SECURITIES EXCHANGES OR CENTRES SHOULD PUT ALL THEIR BONDS PAPER AND PAPERLESS UNDER THE CENTRAL CUSTODY CENTERS OF THE EXCHANGES AND TRADING CENTRES THE REPORT SAID (50JC0106)
ONLY AFTER THAT WILL THEY BE ABLE TO TRADE THEIR BONDS ON EXCHANGES OR STATE APPROVED ELECTRONIC SECURITIES TRADING SYSTEMS IT SAID (50JC0107)
ANY ISSUANCE OF CUSTODY CERTIFICATES MUST BE BACKED BY AN EQUAL AMOUNT OF NOTE BONDS AND INSTITUTIONS WHOSE BONDS FALL SHORT MUST MAKE UP THE SHORTFALL BY JUNE TWENTIETH THE RULE SAID (50JC0108)
THE THE DECREE MANDATES THAT BOND HOLDERS MUST BE ABLE TO EXCHANGE CUSTODY CERTIFICATES FOR PAPER BONDS AT ANY TIME (50JC0109)
NO CERTIFICATE ISSUER CAN REFUSE A REQUEST IT SAID (50JC010A)
THE FINANCE MINISTRY RECENTLY CLAIMED SUCCESS IN THIS YEAR'S ISSUE OF TWO AND THREE YEAR TREASURY BONDS SAYING THAT BY MAY TWENTY FIFTH THE TWENTY SEVEN BILLION YUAN QUOTA FOR TWO YEAR BONDS HAD BEEN OVERSUBSCRIBED AND THAT SALES WOULD END BEFORE JUNE (50JC010B)
